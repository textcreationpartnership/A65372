            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:35410:3"/>The Reverend Author, albeit Eminently indued with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Facultie for diſcuſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſies (wherewith his time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded), yet much more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in practical &amp; caſe-divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Sweeter &amp; nobler Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of a Man of God, and more ſut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſweetneſs of hsi Spirit, and more profitable to the Church and people of the Lord. And in this he did excell, having the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak a word in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, both to the weary and ſecure. His lips did feed many, and his Doctrine drop like the Dew, to water the withered, revive and refresh the heavy and languishing ſoul, and make the Wilderneſs bloſſome. Ane litle enſample wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, theſe few Sermons gives you. He needs no Elogies, eſpecially
<pb facs="tcp:35410:3"/>from ſo mean a hand, as mine. His praiſe is in the Churches, and his memorie bliſſed, His Name fragrant, and the Fruits of his labours witneſſing for him, among the People over whom the Lord did ſet him. His Epiſtle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatorie is largely written in the Hearts of many in <hi>Forgan</hi> and the parts adjacent, where he first ſerved in the Goſpell, and had a most ſucceſful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, both for Converſion and Edification. Many a bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and Excellent dayes of the Son of Man, did God Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with, there: and ſcarce have I ſeen a ſweeter face of a Congregation, then that in <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> uſed to be: His Auditorie was uſuallie diſmiſſed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtamp, then they came,

Nor was he at <hi>Kilmarnock</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a remarkable Seal of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie, though in a time of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Deſertedneſs and upſitting among People; ſo rich a bliſſing did follow and accompany, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Maſter did ſend him; and this, even to the Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many, who were carryed away with the Contradiction of theſe reeling times. But, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerved his Generation by the will of God, with whom he walked and keep'd intercourſe in his Life, and wreſtled and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, like a Prince, as one of the Seed of Jacob, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time before his Death, he there fell aſleep, and now Reſts from his Labours, and this
<pb facs="tcp:35410:4"/>peice of his works follow him. Being Dead, he yet ſpeaketh thereby; and it is hoped, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſober people will not want an Eare to Heare. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe Sermons will be verie acceptable to many in <hi>Fyffe,</hi> who were wont to think it edifying to have the least of privat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſuch a ſpiritual and ſavorie Servant of Jeſus, and to be refreshed even to ſee his face in a pulpit. Had he lived to have polished them for the preſs, they might have comed forth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, more accurat and in a finer dreſs, yet as they are, you will find them pretious, material, and of ſingular uſe for promoting the power of piety. And, though a <hi>Poſthumous</hi> work, (published by his hopeful Son, who not willing to
<pb facs="tcp:35410:5"/>detain ſuch a Talent hid by him, letteth thee now have it for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſe) no more needs be ſaid to Recommend it to thy ſerious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, but to tell thee; they are Sermons of Learned and Holy <hi>Mr. Wedderburne.</hi> Which if they get a favorable intertainment, and be well improven to thy edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, moe may follow; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Diſcouragements of this iron-age.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Rom the 17, Verſe of this Chap: the Apoſtle is confuteing, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved opinion amongſt the Jews of his time, that they ſhould be juſtifyed by the knowledge of the law, and their being able to inſtruct others out of it. The Apoſtle ſuppoſes all alonge their light to be ſo great as to approve the things that are moſt excellent, yea, and that they are able to teach others. But ſince they practiſed not anſwerable to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Apoſtle finds in their condition rather matter for accuſation then juſtification <hi>thou that teaches another teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi> In the preceeding verſe, which is ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this verſe; <hi>thou that ſayeſt thou shalt not commit adultry.</hi> The Apoſtl's ſcop then in the words is to ſhew them, that their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35410:7"/>and profeſſion would profit them little, ſo long as their converſation and way was ſo unſutable to it; and in the Apoſtl's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to evince this, we have a conceſſion and a correction; the conceſſion, the Apoſtle ſuppoſes them to have in reference to adultry and idolatrie not only ane outward profeſſion of averſneſs from them but an inward anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathie againſt them; they not only ſaid a man ſhould not commit adultrie, but inwardly they abhorred Idols; the word in the Grek language <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. it ſignifies properly to hate a thing for the filthy ſmell it hath; ſo ſpecious a profeſſion had they againſt adultrie, and ſuch an abhorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Idolatrie of the heathen, that they ſaid a man ſhould not commit adultrie and they abhorred Idolls.</p>
            <p>The correction contains, as Interpreters generallie obſerve, an aggravatione of the guiltineſs of their practice from the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>does thou commit?</hi> the proponing by way of queſtion is very emphatick, as if it were ſo abſurd for them that ſaid ſo much, that poſitively he will not aſſert it.</p>
            <p>Some move a queſtion why the Apoſtle changes the word Idolatrie into ſacriledge? He ſayes not thou that abhorreſt Idols, does thou commit Idolatrie, but Sacriledge? I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35410:7"/>purpoſe not in this Sermon to ſearch into the name of the things mentioned in the verſe, adulterie, idolatrie and ſacriledge; only to the queſtion, ſome ſay the change is only in words, not of things, for Idolatrie is an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent kind of ſacriledge, in regard it robs God of the worſhip inſtitute by himſelf, and gives unto an idoll falſe worſhip. Others think the kind of ſin is varyed indeed, and, which is moſt probable, the change having a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Emphaſis in it, the Apoſtle by it ſaying this much to them, that though they abhorred ſome kind of ſins ſuch as pagan idolatrie, yet they practized of another kind no leſs disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to God, and dangerous to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I ſhall ſay no more for opening the meaning and ſcop of the words. There is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one obſervation from them I purpoſe in this Sermon to inſiſt upon, but ſhall name two or three ariſing from them, ere we come to it.</p>
            <p>OBSERVATION I. <hi>That the bare knowledge and profeſſion of divine truths, without an anſwerable converſation to them;</hi> can profit <hi>nothing before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THough knowledge, in excellency, be a qualification nixt unto grace, yet where ſeparat from practiſe, it produces only a being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35410:8"/>beaten with many ſtryps, yea, to own a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of holineſs without the practiſe, like to ſome change-houſes wher ye ſhall find a ſigne of an Angel before the door and nothing within but rioting and drunkenneſs. This is but from our profeſſion to agrege the guilt of our converſatione. If any by the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion here, get no more but the naked knowledge of ſomewhat they knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and do not bring it home to practice, hes but coled the candle to let them ſee better to the chambers of hell: no that ye are to deſpiſe knowledge, much affection and zeal many have without this is like to one who hath two ſtrong leggs for an journey, and with all two blind eyes: Eſpecially it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a time wherein ſo many deluded with error, and wherein we are called out to give a reaſon of the hope that is in us.</p>
            <p>OBS. 2. <hi>That one may have not only an outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of holyneſs, but alſo ſome inward work on the affections and yet be in a very dangerous eſtate before God.</hi> So theſe Jews, they not only <hi>ſaid,</hi> but they <hi>abhorred</hi>Idols.</p>
            <p>WHat a length an hypocrit may go at a like occaſion to this, we did lately handle, only now learn, not only not to glorie in a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35410:8"/>profeſſion, as I fear ſome among you do; ye know what he was who ſaid <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord.</hi> Beware of glorying of this, but reſt not, Even upon ſomewhat beyond ſome inward work amongſt the affections: thou may taſte even of the powers of the life to come as the Author to the Hebrews Heb. 6. teſtifies and yet want the thing that muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie ſalvation.</p>
            <p>OBS. 3. <hi>That ſome may be abhorring evills of ſome kinds, and yet wallowing in others no leſs dangerous nor dishonorable to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THey <hi>abhorred Idolls,</hi> but <hi>committed Sacriledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews were ſo punctual obſervers of the Sabbath day, that they will not ſuffer the bodies to hing on the croſſe: John: 19.31. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Sabbath day.</hi> But they ſtood not upon the murder of Him whom even Pilat judged an Innocent. Here is great neid of watchfulneſs, whill our zeall runs out againſt evills of our neighbours, we be not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining worſe in our ſelves, often it is but an Imaginarie evill wee condemne in others, whill reall ones are foſtered in our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Math: Pariſienſis tells us of a Biſhop of Cremona, who was ſent Legat from Rome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35410:9"/>to England, and in a Synod at Londone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed exceedingly againſt the married Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, often ſaying it was an ſhame for an man to riſe from the ſide of an whoore and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat the body of Chriſt, and the ſame night he was taken in bed with an whoore himſelf. It is true, perfit cleanſing, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, yet it is no wher promiſed, nor can it be expected here, yet how dreadfull is it to be wallowing in things worſe or as evill as that we condemn in others. How many ſeem to cloſe out that theef at the doore which by the window comes in and Robs them. While thou condemnes the adultry, drunkenneſs, ſwearing, of others, (which is thy duty), watch left thou be guilty of the hypocriſie, earthly mindedneſs, that abounds in others. If thou ſhall ſay, this is even the thing the openly flagitious tells us when we reprove their ſins, that we are Hypocrits. But how ſinfully ſoever they act in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching thee, thou oughteſt do with their charge as Moſes did Exod. 3. with the Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Hebrew, who told him, <hi>who made thee a judge, will thou kill me, as thou did the Aegyptian;</hi> Moſes goes not to revile him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but ſearches what good uſe he may make of it, <hi>ſurely,</hi> ſayeth he, <hi>this thing is known, and he flies to Midian.</hi> Do thou ſo with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ſearch if there be not ſome truth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35410:9"/>in the thing, and flie to a place of refuge. But I come to that obſervation I purpoſe to inſiſt on, and which is the chiefe ſcop of the verſe.</p>
            <p>OBS. 4. <hi>That it is a great aggravation of the guiltineſs of our lives and converſations, when our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and profeſſed principles may be brought as a witneſs againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THus here the Apoſtle agreges the Guilt of their committing of adultry from this, <hi>thou ſayeſt, thou shall not commit adultry,</hi> this being the ſcop of the verſe, we ſhall inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, Iſt, prove it from Scripture; then give ſome grounds of it, and ſo apply it.</p>
            <p>The truth of the point is evident from Scripture, two inſtances we ſhall give in the Old Teſtament, and two in the New.</p>
            <p>CVI. Pſalm, the ſcop of which Pſalm is to exaggerat the guiltineſs of Iſrael when in their paſſage throw the wilderneſs, <hi>they tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and luſted in the wilderneſs,</hi> and all ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated from this, viz. that at their paſſage thorow the red Sea <hi>they believed God, and ſang his praiſe:</hi> and if you will look to the ſong they lung Exod. 15.11. <hi>Who is God ſave the Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>who is like unto the Lord among the Gods?</hi> who is like, ſay they, and yet in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35410:10"/>that Pſal. v. 20. <hi>they changed their glorie into the ſimilitude of an oxe;</hi> that they ſhould ſay, who is like unto the Lord among the Gods, and yet change the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus Nathan aggravats Davids, guilt in his murder of Urijah. 2. Sam. 12. Iſt, gets him to confeſs this principle, that the rich man who had wronged the poore of his one little lambe deſerved to die; Davids ſin was contrair to the principle he himſelf had laid, and from this Nathan aggrava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it.</p>
            <p>The like in the New Teſtament, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees laid this for a principle, that Moſes and the Prophets ſhould be believed, and Chriſt frequently aggravats the guilt of their deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and from this very principle. So Peter aggravats the ſin of Ananias and Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, calling it a <hi>lying to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they laid this principle, that it was good to ſell their goods and lay them done at the Apoſtles feet, and yet keeped back a part; had they never laid ſuch a ground it had not bein a lying to the Holy Ghoſt. Many ſuch inſtances we might bring to confirm the truth of the point, and there be theſe things which tend further to confirme it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſin againſt profeſſed principles hath in it all the aggravations that a ſin againſt knowledge hath; for to profeſs and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any thing for a principle, neceſſarily
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35410:10"/>ſuppoſes the knowledge of it, now ſins againſt knowledge are by ſome well reſembled to cloath which hath an ſcarlet dy upon it, it is the ſame ſin an other commits, but in the ignorant, it is of an whit color, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what it is when committed againſt knowledge; there are two great aggravations ſins againſt knowledge have in them, iſt, there muſt be a predominant love to the ſin. and hatred to its contrary. Though affections are not the guid of the mind, yet they often bind it, and it is from them men act contrary to known truth, 15. John towards the cloſe, <hi>but now they have both hated me and my father.</hi> Hated me, why more <hi>now,</hi> then before? ſie the reaſon why it muſt be hatred of me, <hi>if</hi> I <hi>had not come and ſpoken to them.</hi> Chriſt had convinced their underſtanding, and yet they imbrace him not: this muſt preceed his hatred. 2dly, ſins againſt knowledge, their greatneſs appears in this, that they are not ſo eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, as ſins done ignorantly, as Pauls perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Church, which he did ignorantly, had he done it after he had changed his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he had not ſo eaſily obtained mercy.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to ſin againſt profeſſed principles will make heathens in their religion's to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt us, often the Lord aggravats Iſraels ſin from the practice of the heathen <hi>have any of the nations changed their God?</hi> if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35410:11"/>we ſhould look through all religions, whereof hiſtories are full, we ſhall find the fondeſt and fooliſheſt carefull to come up to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Romans abounded in ſacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the principle they had drunk in from Numa Pompilius taught them ſo. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians were famous for the like ſtrict conformity to their principles and lawes: Specially the Lacedemonians were famous for abſtinence becauſe Lycurgus lawes, which were their profeſſed principles, led them to it. Accoſta the Jeſuit, in his Indian Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, tells us, that among them the moſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Mothers would cut the throats of their own children, becauſe their Idolatrous principle led them to ſuch ſacrifices; Do not Mahumitans abſtain from Wyne, Papiſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the moſt painfull peregrinations and ſcourgings, multitude of Saints dayes, and all that they may not contradict their principles. Now all this witneſſe againſt us when our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed principles contradict our way.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, To contradict our profeſſed principles makes a man a witneſs againſt himſelf. The man who had the one talent is at a great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage when his judge tells him, <hi>from thy own mouth I condemn thee.</hi> He had laid his principle that his Lord wes an hard man, &amp; reaped wher he did not ſow, <hi>thou oughteſt therfor, ſayes his Lord, have put my money to the exchangers.</hi> This
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35410:11"/>ſtops a mans mouth at firſt, and makes him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unexcuſable, when his profeſſed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples depons againſt his practice, Rom. 2.1.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to ſin againſt acknowledged principles ſuppoſing the principles to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, is the higheſt contempt of God that can be, ſo Pſal. 50. <hi>Conſider this ye that forget God, leaſt I aryſe and tear you in pieces:</hi> forget God, who are theſe? ſie them in the preceeding part of the Pſalm, <hi>ye who take my Covenant in your mouth, and yet when you fie a theef, rune with him, and become partner with the vyle adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer.</hi> They profeſſed his Covenant, and practiſed adultery, and ſuch are called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getters of God, and ſuch he will aryſe and tear in pieces, when there ſhall be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver. To ſin againſt acknowledged principles, hath in it a deſpyſing of the Law; and he that deſpyſeth the law, ſayeth Iſaiah, deſpyſeth the law-giver.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, to ſin againſt acknowledged prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, hath affinity to the ſins of thoſe who are moſt ſignally marked for ſin in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Saul profeſſed with tears, David was Innocent, and more righteous then he, and profeſſed he knew the Lord would make him King in his ſtead, yet we find him ſhortly after in armes againſt him. Judas knew Chriſt an Innocent, and called him Maſter, and yet betrayed him. Pilat declared him an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35410:12"/>and yet delivered him to be crucified. It evidenceth the rage and dominion of any luſt in the heart, when the accompliſhment of it is driven over our very light, like Saul to make a law to expell all witches out of Iſrael, and yet himſelf to ſeek to one, it evidences indeed the Lord had departed from him.</p>
            <p>All theſe and many more might be brought to evidence the truth of the point, that to ſin againſt acknowledged divine principles, is an great aggravation of our Guiltineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is only one uſe of this I ſhall inſiſt upon, it ſerves for humiliatione and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victione of ſuch as contradict in their practice, their profeſſed principles; it is a ſad complaint the Lord hath of Iſrael, Jer. 2.10, 11. <hi>Paſs over to the Iſles of Chittim and ſie — if there hath been done ſuch a thing as this; hath a nation changed their Gods, &amp; caet. but my people hath changed their glory for that which doth not profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heathens follow their acknowledged princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and are ours any worſe, or any thing more queſtionable then theirs? But that this point may be the more preſſing, I ſhall not inſiſt in opening the contradiction of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which even by the light of nature heathens have been taught to lay, which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in their lives full of adultery, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſwearing, lying, make; But there are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35410:12"/>theſe 4 things which by the Scriptures we are taught to lay for principles, and let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little how they are contradicted in our lives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a principle in our religion, that the great happineſs of the creatur ſtands in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowſhip with the Creator, Philoſophers have wandred indeed ſo in the ſearch of mans cheefe good, that ſome have reckoned up ſome hundreth of opinions about it. But there is none among us who can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer but the firſt queſtion of our common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, which is the chiefe end of man? but can tell, it is to glorify God and enjoy him; now if thou believes this for a principle and propoſes it in the very entrie of thy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, I ſhall ſay to thee, as Samuel did to Saul, when Saul told him he had fulfilled the command of the Lord againſt Amaleck, <hi>what meaneth then,</hi> ſaid Samuel, <hi>the Bleating of theſe Sheep?</hi> If thou take this for a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what meaneth, Firſt, thy contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without communion with him, not counting the want of it thy affliction and croſs? what account of his going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his ordinances? can it be thy chief hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and yet thou content without it? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what meaneth ſo many ſteps of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thy converſation, by which thou art incapacitat for communion with him? <hi>if we ſay</hi> to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35410:13"/>
               <hi>we have fellowship with him, and walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we deceave our ſelves,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle John; if we indeed believe this to be our chief happineſs, would there not be more care to be keeped in frame to intertain it, then there is? may I not then ſay to thee, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here to the Jewes, <hi>Thou that ſayes mans chief end is to enjoy God dare thou walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and art thou contended without it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Second principle we all lay in our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of the practice of Holineſs, in order to our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining glory, without it, we all profeſs we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve none can ſie God, what ever difference there be in the Chriſtian Church about the nature of Holineſs, yet that there is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity about the practice of it, is a thing wherein Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians, Lutherians, Antinomians, and Anabaptiſts, and all unit. Now let us ſie how this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is contradicted, 1. How exceeding little of that wherein the life and power of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts! mortification, the exerciſes of faith, love, delight in God, and ſuch like! poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſome care of ſome duties of the ſecond table, which being rightlie performed are acts of obedience to God, but the far greater things neglected! many in theſe be like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who being commanded by his maſter to ſweep the houſe and look to his child, is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35410:13"/>carefull to ſweep the houſe, but lets the child fall in the fire: how would the maſter look on ſuch a ſervant his obedience? that is the caſe with many. Beſide <hi>Secondly,</hi> what a great deal of Antipathie with the followers of Holineſs! Many amongſt us are like to ſome who have ſuch an Antipathie with ſome meat, that not only they cannot eat of it themſelves, but cannot indure to ſie it upon an others trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheor; How much hatred of the Profeſſors of holineſs, and yet all profeſſing they believe the abſolute neceſſity of it. Yea, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the holineſs we profeſſe to be ſo neceſſarie, is a laborious painful work; in the Scripture it is called a ſtriving, a fighting, a running, a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But the way thats generally taken about it, is, as if it were a going to a dancing or ſome paſtime, thou that ſayeſt that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is ſo neceſſary, does thou ſo heartleſly follow it?</p>
            <p>But let us come to a third principle; all of us acknowledge that without a reall change of our eſtait, our way and practice can never be acceptable to God, <hi>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh,</hi> all our ſervice to God, while in the eſtait of nature, is but the ſervice of an enemy, Rom. 7.4. Ye are married to another that ye may bring fruit to God: if we be not married, we are like to a woman that bears children, and hath not a husband, they are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35410:14"/>all baſtards. Now this is not minded in our way, if ſervices be done, whither we be in a ſtate of reconciliation or not, all is one. Hence all our ſervices are never directed to a right end, they proceed not from a right principle; Bruits act not, ſay Philoſophers, for an end, becauſe they act not from a principle of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; neither doe Chriſtians for the honour of God, becauſe not from a principle of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Hence alſo our hatred of ſin is ſo ſervil, we fear it as daming only, like ſome that will not touch a coal, becauſe it is hot, for fear it burne them; but others will not touch it becauſe it is black, leſt it defile them. yea, hence our ſervices are fruitleſſe; we pray and are not heard, they are the requeſts of one in a ſtate of enemity. Now thou that ſayeſt regeneration is neceſſary, that all thy worſhip may be accepted, whence is it, that it is ſo little minded? does not thy practice herein contradict thy principle?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, that I may come to a cloſe, it is one great principle of our religion, that our great work ought to be the exalting of Chriſt. This is it that we that are Miniſters have eſpecially in commiſſion to preach, <hi>He is an elect veſſel, to lift up my name before the Gentils,</hi> ſaid the Lord to Ananias of Paul Acts 9.15. this we are bound to by all the tyes of duety and gratitude, this is the very ſcop
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35410:14"/>of our religion, but how exceedingly is it contradicted? how little are we in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Chriſts excellency in our meetings together? Our diſcourſes are like Pharaohs to Jacob, <hi>how old art thou,</hi> and <hi>what is thy occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation?</hi> who would have thought but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would have come from Pharaoh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the God of Abraham, who was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongſt the Heathen, even at this time? yet nothing of this. If our diſcours of him be little, our meditation is leſſe, our delight leſt of all; our hearts are little in Boyling, as the words in the firſt language, Pſal. 45.1. imports, this good Maſter, though all his garments ſmell of Myrrhe, Aloes, and Caſſia, yet our diſtemper is ſuch, as this ſmell reliſhes not.</p>
            <p>All theſe and a great many more principles, we openly own, are as openly contradicted in our converſation; and how great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Humiliation there is in this, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in theſe things, 1, we not only not walk by principles we profeſſe, but by principles we all diſown; none will defend drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſwearing, Sabboth-breaking, or ſuch like; all even the moſt prophane diſown them: and yet, as if there were a law for them, ſo are they practiſed. Now how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable is this, that not only theſe things which God hath made principles to us
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35410:15"/>are diſowned, but theſe things that he hath forbidden are practiſed, as if they were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? <hi>Secondly,</hi> if our principles were not ſure, our contradiction to them were the leſſe deplorable; But ſo ſure principles, having all the witt of man can imagin, to confirm them. Many popiſh principles are pretended to be no higher then ſome Pop's decrees. But theſe named proceed from him who laid the foundations of the great earth, and ſtreatched out the heavens as a curtain, who weighs the mountains in ballances, and holds the watters in the hollow of his hand; and that they are proceeded from him we have all the ſecurity reaſon can require or imagin. Now that ſuch principles ſhould be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, how lamentable is it! <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as they are ſure, ſo are they exceeding ſweet; David had more joy in Gods teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then in all riches All the contentment Ranters have in their carnall pleaſures are but as ſwyn in a dunghill, their glaſſe goes ſoon out; an hours communion with God, though in a priſon, yea the reproach of Chriſt, as counted by Moſes, who was learned in all the wiſdome of Aegypt, is greater riches then the treaſures of Egypt. And Paul, who was not a little learned in the Grecian wiſdome, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all theſe dung, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the ſuperlativeneſſe of the knowledge of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35410:15"/>Chriſt. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is yet the more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that there is abundance of ſtrength al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to follow our principles, if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, <hi>the rock followes us, and the rock is Chriſt;</hi> he is not only ready to do what we ask, but above all we can ask or think; he deals with us, as Naaman with Gehazi, when he run after him and prayed him to give him one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, I pray thee (ſayes Naaman) take two: It is indeed much to walk up to our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but we baike beſide meall, we are able to do all things throw him that ſtrengthens us; and yet to contradict our principles, is ſad!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it makes it yet more lamentable, that there are ſuch excellent encouragements, &amp; ſo great are ward abyding the walking according to them; neither is it long to the time, when he that ſoweth in the ſpirit ſhall of the ſpirit reap Immortality and life everlaſting: we are not threſhing in the waters, but ſowing in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expectation of a harveſt of glory, and yet to contradict our principles! All theſe laid together evidence how lamentable our contradicting our principles is. I ſhall only adde 3. helps for walking up to our principles, and ſo cloſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider often that there are many things we do out of obedience to the Law of God, we abſtain from murder, adultery, wait
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35410:16"/>on ordinances, think it neceſſary to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more circumſpect about the time of a Sacrament; how unreaſonable is it then, to contradict the lawes of the ſame God, in other things, no leſſe peremptorly commanded, under no leſſe penalty? <hi>God ſpake all theſe words, ſaying,</hi> is the preface to all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the law. If ſome of them had only proceeded from God, and others from Baal, or the God of Ammon, we might eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and diſpenſe with our ſelves, but <hi>God ſpake all theſe words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep up conſtant intercourſe with Chriſt, as the fountaine of ſanctification; do not with him as ſome do with the old cloak, that they will take about them when their is a ſhoure, and caſt it off as ſoon as it becomes fair again: Some in ſickneſſe ſeek their pardon, as one would runne into a ruinous houſe when their is rain, but would not dwell there. If we were dwelling in him and abyding in him, and walking in him, it would be lightſome to walk by our principles, the want of theſe influences, exceedingly occaſions our contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Stand not upon reproaches that often lye in the way of following theſe principles; <hi>Theſe men are drunk with new wine,</hi> ſaid the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, of the Apoſtles, when the ſpirit deſcended on them, no, ſayes Peter, Acts 2.16.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35410:16"/>
               <hi>this is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel,</hi> if thou can produce a line of the Bible thou walkeſt by the Kings Law, which ought to rule all the ſubjects; reproaches then are the fruits of their diſtemper.</p>

                  <p>Husbands love your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere is nothing more ſuitable to a feaſt of love, then to treat of that love which gave a riſe to the feaſt, this is to handle the Goſpell of the day, often believers at ſuch occaſions, are ſo much in toſſing their fears and doubts, that they forget obedience to that precept, <hi>do this in remembrance of me.</hi> My purpoſe therefor in this Sermon, is to glance a little from the words read, at the love of Chriſt manifeſted in the work of redemption; The Apoſtle from 22. verſ. of this Chap. is leaving directions for the right ordering of relations among men, ſhewing to each one the dutyes of their relation: among the reſt, theſe words containe a rule for husbands.</p>
            <p>And in the rule we have a precept, and a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35410:17"/>pattern; The precept, <hi>Husbands love your wives;</hi> the Parterne, <hi>as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> The note of ſimilitude, <hi>As,</hi> which does knitt the precept and patterne together: does not import any equality in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> that ought to be betwixt the love of the husband to his wife and the love of Chriſt to the Church, but only ſome ſimilitude in <hi>kinde.</hi> For 1. This equality is ſimply impeſſible; not only for the nature of man corrupted, for ſo many things God hath commanded are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſo all gracious qualityes are impoſſible; but it is impoſſible for the nature of man, even as it is created, and pure Adam could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedience of infinite value and merit as Chriſt hath done, in loving his Church, and giving himſelf for it. Beſide 2. God cannot in juſtice require of meer man, obedience proceeding from a perſonal union of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane natures, ſuch as Chriſts love manifeſted in giving himſelf for his Church was: Hence divines prove well, that Chriſts obedience to the death, was properly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, becauſe it was <hi>actio indebita,</hi> for tho Chriſt-man, be tyed to obey, yet not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſo noble obedience, in regard Chriſt, as God, can come under no law oblidging to obedience: So that neither could God, require ſuch perfect love, nor was it poſſible even for Adam to performe; Therefore all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35410:17"/>imported in the note of ſimilitude, is ſome kinde of reſemblance betwixt the Husbands love and Chriſts to his Church, as is evident from ſeverall other Scriptures where the ſame is uſed, Gal. 4.14. <hi>Ye receaved me as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord, yea even as Chriſt,</hi> this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports not an equality in degree, betwixt the receaving of Paul and Chriſt, but ſome ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and reſemblance. Thy will be done in earth as it is in Heaven, in that perfect patern of prayer, and many ſuch we might inſtance in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But ſince in this Sermon I purpoſe not a particular handling of the words, I ſhall not inſiſt in a particular explication of them, I ſhall only take one general obſervation from them, and inſiſt upon it at this time.</p>
            <p>Obſervation. <hi>That the love of Chriſt manifeſted in the work of redemption is matchleſs, and may fitly be made a patern and copie to the love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the moſt intimat relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In proſecuting this point which ſo Genuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſeth from this Scripture, there are two things I ſhall premiſe for opening of it. Firſt, my purpoſe is not to ſpeak of the love of Chriſt in the full latitude of it, as it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the love of benevolence &amp; beneficence, and is the root and fountaine whence iſſewes all the acts of grace, terminat to believers, in time and eternity, but only of the love mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35410:18"/>in the work of redemption, this being proper to the Text, He loved his Church and gave himſelf for it. Neither 2dly, can we ſpeake of this love according as the nature of it requires, ſince it is a myſtery, into which even the Angels deſire to pry, all that we can doe, is, to do as the painter who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired to draw the Sunne, did take a black coal to draw it with, ſince he found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to find any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to reſemble it in the beauty and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Only for opening the point a little, we ſhall inſiſt on theſe two, we ſhall prove it and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it. For the proofe of it, that it is match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and may be a pattern for the love requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt intimat relations, we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat this from Scripture and reaſon: and firſt from Scripture, there be five or ſix things in Scripture, which all tend to prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Scripture calls it the love of God. 1. Joh. 3.16. hereby perceave we the love of God, becauſe he laid downe his life for us. Every thing in God is matchleſs, even theſe attributes which are called communicable, there are but ſome ſhaddowes of reſemblance of them in the creatures, but there is a ſpecial reaſon why we ſhould look on his love as ſuch, ſince it is not only tearmed the love of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35410:18"/>God, but God himſelf: <hi>He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, for God is love.</hi> 1. Joh. 4.8 God is love, not only loving, but love it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Scripture proclaims this love incomprehenſible, Eph. 3.19. there is <hi>bredth</hi> and <hi>length</hi> and <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>hight.</hi> Philoſophers will not admit of four dimenſions, but here the Apoſtle, who was aboundantly learned, aſcribs foure to this, as to a thing paſſing all dimenſion, yea and immediatly on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins an expreſſion any would think one part of it inconſiſtant with an other, <hi>and to know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge,</hi> to know it, and yet it paſſes knowledge, in the perfection of it, though a little of it may be known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Scripture aſſimilats it to the love wherewith the Father loves the Sonne: the love of a woman to her ſucking child, or Jonathan to David, are unfit reſemblances of this. There is no love to reſemble it by, but one, 15. John 9. <hi>as the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you.</hi> How great the Fathers love is to the Sonne, is teſtified twice by an immediat voice from Heaven, <hi>My beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> The Prophet I ſaiah calls him <hi>the delight of his Fathers Soule,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. and Chriſt himſelf Prov. 8. Teſtifies that er the foundations of the world were He
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35410:19"/>was <hi>dayly his delight;</hi> and yet as the Father hath loved me, ſo I you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is frequently in Scripture made the pattern and copie of love to all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Not to multiplie inſtances, ye find twice ſo in this ſame chapter v. 2. <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt alſo loved us, and gave himſelf for us.</hi> And here again, in the verſe read, <hi>love your wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> There are indeed ſome copies wherein a ſcholer may out-reach his maſter, but here, as in the firſt verſe of the chap., we muſt be followers of God as dear Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> whenſoever our love to him, yea even of his choiſe Apoſtles, are brought in competition with this love to us, it is ſo farr undervalued that the name of love is denyed to it, like the ſtarres that diſappear as if they were no lights, when the Sunne ariſeth. 1. Joh. 4.10. Herein is love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us. It is ſtrange the Apoſtle gives our love the name of love through all the precepts of that Epiſtle, where love is commanded, But when it is ſet beſide his becoming a propitiation for our ſins, the name of love is denyed to it, <hi>not that we loved him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is in the Scripture made the fountain and ſpring, out of which iſſewes all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35410:19"/>his peoples love to him, as the ſun that is the fountain of all the light in the moon or ſtarrs; Our love, yea of all his elect in all ages, is but a ray, reflecting back again on the ſun whence it proceeded, 1 John 4:19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe in the Scripture layd togither, prove it to be ſuch as it is delineat in the poynt.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, to demonſtrat yet further the truth of the poynt, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his love manifeſted in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, in a fourfold referrence. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it with a reſpect to the <hi>perſon loveing.</hi> 2dly. With a reſpect to the perſons <hi>loved.</hi> 3dly. In the properties of it. 4thly In the <hi>effects</hi> that it hath produced. And all the four will contribut to clear how matchleſs it is, and how fitt to be a paterne to the love of the moſt intimat relations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider it with reſpect to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>loveing,</hi> it is the love of a perſon who is both <hi>God and Man,</hi> which adds a great deal of weight to it. 1. It is the love of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is God. Divyns ſay, it renders the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of infinit value, that it wes the blood of God. Practick divyns ſay, that the ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Chriſt hath with beleevers, is of infinit excelencie, becauſe it is a Sympathie proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a perſon that is God, for ſo he can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35410:20"/>be affected with the evils they feel, and the evils they feil not; and why not an infinit value in his love becauſe it is the love of God? We read in hiſtories of ſingular teſtimonies of love from parents to their children, wives to their husbands, and they reciprocally to them. But no man can put more liquor in a quart bottel, but an quart, he wer mad that ſhould attempt to put the Ocean in a cockil ſhell. Secondly, it was the love of a perſon who was man; in his humane nature, beſide all the infinite habits that wherein him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what were in Adam, he was anointed with the oyle of gladneſs above his fellowes. Beſide that, I ſay, he was content to learn by experience, how to be compaſſionat; He was tempted that he might be the more able to ſuccour theſe that are tempted. He knowes the heart of a ſtranger, as the Lord ſpake of Iſrael, Exod. 16. for he was once a ſtranger himſelf in the Land of Aegypt. Now love proceeding from a perſon, in whom both theſe natures are united, cannot but be match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Remarkable is that word of Bernard, <hi>Dilexit nos Chriſtus duleiter, ſapienter, acfoeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer; Dulciter, quia carnem induit, ſapienter, quia culpam cavit, fortiter, quai Deus erat,</hi> it is ſweet and ſtrong, proceeding from one that is God and man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, conſider with reſpect to theſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35410:20"/>he loved, and this alſo will prove it match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Love uſually is leſs ſingular, if there be any thing in the object attractive of it, as there is when we love him; but here nothing ſuch, if we conſider whom he loved, under a thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion 1. as baſe and ignoble, 2dly, as loathſome, and filthy. 3ly. as not only in a <hi>State</hi> of enemity, but fraughted with <hi>actual</hi> enemity, againſt the perſon loving, 1ſt. as baſe and ignoble, we have indeed ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in hiſtory of love deſcending from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ignoble; But to deſcend ſo low, as to love that that is farther below him, then the baſeſt worme can be below us, there being an infinite diſparity, which cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween meere creatures, what hiſtories can paralel this? Beſide baſeneſs, there is filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loathſomneſs, which being added to the former, makes it admirable Ezek. 16. when thou was lying in thy blood that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a time of love. We were as the word is, Pſal. 14. altogether become filthy, there was none that did good, no not one, and yet to love us? But the 3d added that we were fraughted with enemity againſt him who loved us. Auguſtus Ceſar, becauſe he could not marry a mean woman who loved him, commanded yet a vaſt ſoume to be given here, to teſtify his reſpect to her love. But Rom. 5. <hi>God commended his love to us that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35410:21"/>when we were yet enemies, Chriſt dyed for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> take a view of the properties of this love, and it will appear more match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: amongſt many properties of it, I only mention at preſent theſe four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. it was altogether <hi>free,</hi> there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of nature, for he is admitted by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Iſa. 42. yea we find him offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the work of redemption, when mans caſe is ſeen to be deſperat, Pſal. 40. <hi>Sacrifices and offerings thou didſt not deſire,</hi> and what could man do for reconciliation beyond ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and offerings? and when it is thus, <hi>then ſaid I, behold I come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, It was alſo <hi>ſtronge</hi> and <hi>vehement,</hi> it was indeed a love many watters could not quench, God ſo loved the world, that he gave his Sonne; <hi>ſo</hi> loved, there is a great emphaſis in that <hi>ſo;</hi> Amongſt other things, it imports the tranſcendent fervency of that love manifeſted in the worke of redemption.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, It is a <hi>diſcriminating</hi> love, to <hi>men,</hi> and not to Angels. The Prophet Malachie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the love of Jacob from this, that he hated Eſaw: though Eſaw was Jacobs bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there was nothing in us to caſt the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Angels were more excellent natures, it is true ſome in the ſchools ſay. 1. the ſin of the divel was greater then mans, becauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35410:21"/>their natures were more perfect, and they ſinned without a tempter. Yet even this they cannot deny, but the price payed for loſt man had been ſufficient for their reſtauration, had it been intended for them. Beſide even thoſe ſay, mans ſinnes had ſeveral aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, theirs wanted, ſo that there was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing antecedent in the objects, to excite this love to the one and not to the other, and O how great a difference makes it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it is an <hi>everlaſting</hi> love, that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light was with the ſons of men Pro. 8. <hi>before the mountains were brought forth,</hi> ſo it is to everlaſting. He cannot be budded to alter or change this love; Balaam attempted it with one and twenty ſacrifices, to turn him from loving Iſrael, and to curſe them, but it would not Eſay 54.7. <hi>With an everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on the, ſayes the Lord-thy Redeemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we conſidder this love in the fruits and effects of it, and we ſhall like wayes herein find it matchleſs. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>labor of love,</hi> if ever there was love that might be called a labor of love, it is here. Amongſt many things to manifeſt this, conſider only to what a low eb he was brought in giveing himſelf for his Church, which is the Teſtimony of love the Apoſtle pitches on here, and there be only
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35410:22"/>two things to pitch upon, to evidence this. 1. The <hi>names</hi> that are given him. 2. The ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that he did undergoe, in teſtifying his love to his Church. 1. The <hi>names</hi> that are given him, he is called ane Angel, which was far below him; ane Apoſtle, which was yet lower; a man, and the ſone of man, a Babe, a meſſenger, aſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, a ſhepherd, a worme and not a man, a curſe, and if there can be any thing yet lower, <hi>he became fin for us, that we might become the righteousneſs of God in him,</hi> what a wonderful teſtimony of love is here! He that thought it no robbery, to be equal with God, and was his fellow, to become a <hi>curſe</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> for us! the Apoſt: 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. <hi>v. laſt.</hi> counts it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Myſtery that he was at all manifeſted in the Fleſh; But to be <hi>ſo</hi> manifeſted, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful is it! But in the 2d place, if we ſhould take a view of his ſufferings that he did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe in his humane nature in teſtifieing this love, when he gave himſelf for his Church, what reproach, what torment what, A gony in his Spirit: it was ſtrang to hear that come from Him, <hi>my ſoul is heavy, and what shall I ſay,</hi> He was <hi>bruiſed</hi> or as the word imports in the firſt Language, <hi>Baken,</hi> for our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Nether can <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> nor any other Jeſuit, prove that he merited any thing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his ſuffering, but it was wholly intended for us. This teſtimony of his love is that which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35410:22"/>we are come togither the day to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, and which is repreſented in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bread and pouring out of the wyn.</p>
            <p>Now let us lay all theſe togither, and ſee if the poynt be not proven, that his love is matchleſs, and may be a copie for the moſt ſpecial and intimat love, required in the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt relations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is only one uſe of exhortation, which I ſhall follow from this poynt thus opened, and we ſhall divide it in two brances. 1. It ſerves to exhort to admire and praiſe his love. 2. To render love to him for love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, It ſerves to exhort to admire and praiſe his love. Let men diſput as they will whither Chriſt as Mediator be the object of divine worſhip, we may ſaffly determine that his love manifeſted in the redemption of loſt man, is a fitt object of admiration &amp; praiſe. Saul much admired it and commended it in David when he found him in the cave and did not kill him, will a man find his Enemie (ſaid Saul) and will he not kill him? But how would Saul have ſpoken of this, for a man to find his enemy &amp; willingly be killed for him! May we not all ſit downe at this table, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>David</hi> when he heard of the death of Jonathan, <hi>O Jonathan, Jonathan, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful was thy love to me! It was beyond the love
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35410:23"/>of women!</hi> And that we may make the better progreſs in this work of admireing and praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his love; I ſhall offer you ſome helps to it. There are ſome confiderations, and ſome practiſes, whereby we may be furthered in it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider, admiring and praiſing his love is the conſtant worke of theſe who are in glory, John in his Revelation tels us he often heard them crying; <hi>Worthy is the Lambe who was ſtain,</hi> This is the ſonge of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lambe, that is ſung there, and in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this he breaks off the <hi>Revelation, Rev.</hi> 1: <hi>v.</hi> 5. with theſe words, <hi>Now to him that loved us and washed us from our ſins, in his own blood, to him be glory and dominion for ever.</hi> If we would have a communion day reſembling heaven, this muſt be our worke alſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider this is the proper work of the day; However beleivers be taken up with toſſing their doubts and fears, yet there may be ſomething of a tentation in this, to divert them from ſomething more ſuitable to their preſent work, it is ane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Argument ſome bring to prove that the primitive Church did not kneel in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Sacrament, becauſe they did not kneel for ſome Centuries on the Sabbath at all, looking upon it as a day of joy for Chriſts reſurrection. It is trew in this Sabboth we are met to commemorat a death, and that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35410:23"/>death of the moſt loveing husband that ever had a being. Yet ſince it is the death of one who hath overcome death, and who hath ſent us word, Revel. 1: 18. <hi>I am he that was dead, and am alive;</hi> our work ought to be praiſes and admiration.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider there is nothing we can repay for all the love He hath manifeſted yea there is nothing elſe he requires but praiſes and admiration. The deliverance from Egypt coſt Iſrael many of their beſt and cheiffeſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, there is nothing ſuch here, <hi>Offer to me the ſacrifices of thanksgiving</hi> is all that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and when will this ſacrifice be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not upon ſuch a day?</p>
            <p>But this and many ſuch conſiderations; though they may convince the minde, that the thing is rational yet not ſufficiently help to it, if theſe practiſes be not added.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Labor to get the heart in frame for praiſes and admiring this love; from what thou haſt heard, thou mayſt perceave thou haſt ane excellent ſong, but if the inſtrument be out of tune, it may be ſpilt, as many a good tale is in the telling, the 108 Pſal. begins well, <hi>My heart is fixed, Lord, I will ſing,</hi> get thy heart fixed, that is poſſibly like Iſrael in Eliahs tyme, halting betwixt two, then praiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, repel the tentations that would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35410:24"/>put thee by from praiſing and admireing this love; ſay to them that which Felix ſaid to Paul <hi>I will hear thee at a more convenient tyme;</hi> ſhall thou come to a mariage-feaſt, where thou art called to ſinging in thy mourning ſuit? Or is Chriſts love in giveing himſelf, any thing the leſs worthy, that thy heart is ill?</p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay this is eaſier ſaid then done, they are not tentations but well-grounded reaſons, that keep me back from admireing and praiſing this love. Chriſtian what are they? 1. Some ſay let them praiſe and admire who are intereſted in it and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantadged by it, but thou art not ſuch a one; but 1. thou commends many things thou art not much advantadged by. The courage of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander; the Policie of Hanibal, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Solon; the bounty of Veſpaſian, ar all much comended in Hiſtories, and yet the writters of all theſe Hiſtories not much profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of them: Chriſts love is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mankind and praiſe worthy, be it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat to thee or not: Beſide, many praiſe, ſuch as the glorified Angels, that are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in it; if thou ſhalt ſay He is to them a Mediator of Confirmation; many great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyns ſay ſo indeed, and others deny it, and as it is not eaſy to prove from Scriptur, ſo not eaſy to anſwer The objections brought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35410:24"/>againſt it. However, He was not to them a Mediator of redemption, and yet they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and praiſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> thou mayſt have intereſt in it, and yet not deſcerne it. Chriſt, ſay practical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, hath delivered believers from all danger of vindictive wrath, but not from all the fear of it, till they come to glorie: Thy fears then are no proof of thy danger. But if all theſe will not doe, get intereſt yet in it; it is the ſcope of the work of the day to make an offer of it. Imbrace his offer, it is free, and ſo praiſe.</p>
            <p>Others ſay, they cannot praiſe; though they will not deny their intereſt in it, yet they are under a preſent deſertion, and ſo cannot praiſe nor admire. This objection Sion makes Iſay 49. v. 14. The Lord calls on heaven and earth to ſing, becauſe of the Covenant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: Sion ſayes, ſing who will I will ſing none, Sion ſaid <hi>I am forſaken, my God hath caſt me off.</hi> It is true, it is with us as the Marygold that opens and ſhuts or cloſſes as the Sunne riſes and goes down, yet be doing it as thou may; the Lord ſometimes denyes aſſiſting grace, that his accepting grace may ſhine the brighter. If he give the poor wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow but two mits to caſt into the treaſury, it is all one, if he Counts the two mits: The pureſt obedience; though, I confeſs, not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35410:25"/>the moſt comfortable, is to doe duties under a deſertion, praiſe it then and admire it.</p>
            <p>But I go to the ſecond branche of the uſe. If his love be ſo matchleſs, render him love for love. It is reported of holy Bredfoord, that ſome tymes the tears would be running downe on his truncheor, when ſitting at his meat, and when he was asked the reaſon of it, he ſaid becauſe he could not get fervent enough love to Chriſt, our obligation to Chriſt is ſuch that the coldneſs of our love is wonderful; eſpecially the exerciſe of love is ſuitable to this feaſt. Zenophon in his Cyrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tels of one Lygranes, King of Armenia, who was taken with his Queen captive by Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus on a tyme, Cyrus asked him if he deſyred his liberty, and to have his Kingdome, and his Wife reſtored to him; Lygranes anſwered him, For my liberty and my Kingdome I prayſe them not much, but if my heart blood could redeeme my Wyffe, I would cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully give it: afterward Cyrus haveing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him all, and he was comes home in his Kingdome, he asked his Queen what a one ſhe thought Cyrus was; ſhee replyed, ſhe knew not, my heart and my mynd (ſaid ſhe) was ſo much taken up with the man who would have given his blood for my ranſome, that I could think upon no other. If a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could ſay ſo much of one who made but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35410:25"/>ane offer of his blood for her ranſome, O how much more we of Him, who hath gone far begond offers. He hath loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood. But ſince the exerciſe of love is ſo ſuitable a work to a feaſt of love, and one great part of our communion with him in the ſacrament, herin, I ſhall only give thir things to try the ſincerity of our love, and ſo cloſe. 1. Thou moſt take up a-right the nature of love; many think they love him becauſe they doe not hate him; <hi>quid eſt amor,</hi> ſaid bleſſed Auſtin, <hi>niſi quaedam vita duo aliqua copulans, vel copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare appetens, quod ſcilicet amat, &amp; quod amatur.</hi> This indeed is ane love which cannot be ſatisfied without enjoying of Chriſt; is thine of this nature or art thou content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> love to him darkens and abats love of all other things in the ſoul. This Character uſually practick divins give of it. <hi>Tanto quiſque</hi> (ſaid Bernard) <hi>à ſuperno amore disjungitur, quanto inferius delectatur.</hi> It ſets well in tryall of our love, to ask our hearts the queſtion he himſelf asked Peter, <hi>Symon, ſone of Jonas, loveſt thou me more then theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> love to him is alwayes attended with love to his people and intereſts. 1. <hi>Epiſt. Joh.</hi> 2. The Apoſtle is large in proveing this, <hi>If we love him that begetts we love alſo them that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35410:26"/>are begotten.</hi> It is true our love to them ought not to be ſo fervent as to him, but yet it ſtill keeps a proportione to it, as the ſune in the dyall, though it move not ſo faſt as in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, yet it keeps a proportione to it, it cannot be goeing forward in the firmament and backward or ſtanding ſtill in the dyall. Try by theſe your love, and finding it, ye may the ore chearfully come to a banquet of love.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Prophet propheſied in the dayes of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, wee find him mentioned, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14: 25. where he is called a Prophet and ſervant of the Lord, and though he propheſied of proſperitie, yet with ſmall ſucceſs in ſo corrupt a tyme. Wherefore the Lord ſends him to Nineve the Chief city of the Aſſyrian Empyre, which he is loath to undertake, partly from fear,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35410:26"/>and partlie (as ſome think) loath to Carry a Meſſage from the Jews to the Gentills: wherefore he reſolves to flee by ſea to Tarſhiſh. The Lord followes him with a ſtorme; and when all in the Ship are at prayer to their Gods, he is aſleep. For which, in the words read, he is reprehended by the Shipmaſter, <hi>what meaneſt thou o ſleeper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words, though they be the words of ane heathen, yet they contain a deſerved reprehenſion of a prophet of Iſraell; and in them are 2. things. 1. A deſcription of the perſons reprehending and reprehended, and both deſcryved from their preſent work and conditione, the one is the <hi>Shipmaſter,</hi> and the other <hi>a ſleeper.</hi> 2dly The reprehenſion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>what meaneſt thou,</hi> or, as the word in the firſt language, <hi>what to thee?</hi> A ſhort pathetick ſpeach, expreſſing anger in the reprehender, and unreaſonablneſs in the reprehended. There is nothing difficult in the words, that we need to inſiſt in explicating; <hi>ſleeping,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in be taken figurativly in ſcripture, ſome tymes denoting the carnall ſecurity of one in a naturall conditione; as Eph. 4. <hi>awak thou that ſleepeſt;</hi> ſometyms the quiet repoſe a beleever hath in God, as Pſal. 3: 4. <hi>I will lay me downe and ſleep,</hi> yet here it is taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, yet ſo as it denotats alſo untymous ſecurity, when there was ſo great a ſtorme;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35410:27"/>and all at prayer that were in the Ship with them.</p>
            <p>There is one Obſervation I purpoſe to inſiſt upon, but we ſhall ſpeak a word of ane other, ere we come to it.</p>
            <p>Obſervat. 1. <hi>That ſecurity, when dangers are imminent, is unreaſonable; even in the eye of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. Sudden and unexſpected ſurpriſes add much to the weight of any danger; as in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> Peter makes it a great agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatione of their ſtroak, that they wer eating drinking, marying and giveing in mariage, and the deludge came; a tryall hath no ſmall advantage of us when it finds us aſleep. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid could take Sauls ſpear from his head in the midſt of his Army, when he aſſaults him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep. Nature teaches men to flee to ſome beeld when clouds gather that threatten rain; Its true the Lord would not have his people anxiouſly vex themſelves with thoughts of the croſſe before it come, ſufficient for the day are the ſorrows of it; If he bring thee to the Wilderneſs, he can alſo rain Manna; In it the promiſes of God are the promiſes of a Father, and ſuch a Father as in the Firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creed, we call a Father Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo let our ſorrowes, which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, let them be what they will there is ſufficient ground of a ſweet and quyet repoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35410:27"/>in God; But this maks nothing againſt the truth of the poynt; we doe not onely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract to the poſitive Lawes of God, but to the very dictats and precepts of nature, If tryals that are makeing ſo lowd a noiſe ſhall find us ſecure and aſleep. As it is our great mercy to be ſo long warned before the ſtroake, the axe (as it were) lying at the root of the tree before it ſmit; So they rightly improve theſe warnings, that does as the Apoſtle Heb. 11. ſayeth Noah did, <hi>By faith Noah being warned by God, and moved with fear, prepared ane Arke to ſave himſelf and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come to the obſervation I purpoſe to inſiſt on.</p>
            <p>Obſervat. 2d. <hi>That the worshipers of the true God are ſometyms outſtriped, and may be juſtly reprehended, for their neglect of worship, by the worshipers of Idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is Jonah a Prophet of Iſrael and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, here by a Heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner. The lyke we find, Gen. 20: 6. <hi>Thus was she reproved;</hi> this word is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our purpoſe, Abimelech ſaid to Sarah, behold I have given thy Brother a thouſand peices of Silver, and then it is added, thus was ſhee reproved; Abimelechs upright and liberal dealing reproves Sarahs deceit: Sarah is not only outſtriped, but even deſervedly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35410:28"/>reproved by Abimelech ane Heathen.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is not in proſecuting this poynt, to compare togither Idolaters in their moral induements, or the performing of the duties of the ſecond Table, with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers of the true God, none that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with the Hiſtories of their lives or their writings, but will eaſily diſcerne, how far they have outſtriped us; Here it is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragment to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all his victories recorded by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> to ſay, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriped him in <hi>magnanimity and fortitude;</hi> And if I ſhould inſiſt but upon three of them, who among the worſhipers of the true God, can go beyond them, for excellent moral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts? <hi>Plato,</hi> who for his precepts is called <hi>divinus,</hi> and is thought by ſome to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Auguſtin</hi> at length con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uts in his book of the City of the God, ſhewing that Plato lived ane hundreth Years after <hi>Jeremiah</hi> his being in Aegypt, and flowriſhed threeſcore years before the ſeptuagints tranſlatione; or if I ſhould name <hi>Seneca,</hi> whoſe Epiſtles containe ſuch excellent precepts for a moral life, that ſome think he exchanged Epiſtles with Paul at <hi>Rome;</hi> Or <hi>Cicero,</hi> for whoſe ſalvation <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> does plead, as one who had improved nature to the outmoſt; I ſay, my purpoſe is not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35410:28"/>to compare the worſhipers of the true God with them in theſe moral Qualifications, in which, at leaſt ſome, have far, very far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded us.</p>
            <p>My ſcop is only to compare with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers of the true God in their worſhip; to this only my text leads. It is for neglect of this, that Jonah is reprehended and I ſhall labour to make it evident that, how falſe ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their worſhip was, yet they have far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriped and may juſtly reprehend the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the true God in the exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> though their Gods were no Gods, but Devils, falſhood and vanity, had eyes and ſawe not, ears and heard not, yet did they highly eſteem them, &amp; reverence them, Micha. 5. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natione walks in the name of their God,</hi> amongſt other things imported in walking in the name of their Gods, this is one, they did boaſt and triumph in their Gods, ſo the Epheſians, Acts 19. all with one ſhout cryed, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> Idolatrous Micaah, though he made his God himſelf, yet can ſay of it, My <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>what have I more?</hi> And if I ſhould tell what Them cydydes reports of the eſteeme the ancient Grecians had of their Gods; or <hi>Livius</hi> of the Romans, how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they puniſhed the leaſt diſhonour done to the Gods, I might take up a long tyme; now let us compare this with the worſhipers of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35410:29"/>true God, who triumphs in God or makes their boaſt of him? as David ſaid his ſoul did; is he exalted as God? or confided in as God? or do we walk in the name of our God as every nation does?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> as they did highly eſteem their Gods, ſo they were painful and frequent in the worſhiping of them; even idolatrous Iſrael when they are imitating them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8: 2. ſee what ane account <hi>Jeremiah</hi> gives of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, <hi>Whom ye have loved, whom ye have ſerved, whom ye have worshiped, and after whom ye have gone.</hi> So many words to expreſs their indefatigablneſs in their Idolatry. The Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens haveing ſuch a multitude of Gods, one almoſt for every thing, could not chooſe but but be put to ane great deal of pains in hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their worſhipe; Amongſt Lycurgus lawes one asked him why he appoynted ſo little for one ſacrifice, to them he anſwered, becauſe he had appoynted men to be very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in ſacrificeing to them; Now compare this with the way of the worſhipers of the true God: it is true our principles teach us a neceſſity of diligence in worſhip, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we Aim at ſuffers violence: But who runs, ſtrives, fights, labours, according to their principles? or of whoſe way can there be ſuch account given, in reference to God? <hi>Whom ye have loved, whom ye have ſerved, whom
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35410:29"/>ye have worshiped, and after whom ye have gone.</hi> It is but ſome feckleſs thing we do, and rarely wee do that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As they were painful in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipe to their Gods, ſo they were very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and zealous and intent upon it. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. <hi>v.</hi> 5. Iſrael is challenged there among other things, for <hi>inflamming themſelves with Idols:</hi> They were inflammed as a whore is with her luſt; <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> appoynted ſome in the Roman proceſſions to go crying, <hi>hoc agite;</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> forbad ſacrifices to be offered when doing or thinking upon any other thing. compare this with the way of worſhip to the true God, though our rule oblige us to this, <hi>be fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord,</hi> yet how oft is our heart in his worſhip like Iſrael in Elijahs tyme, halting betwixt two? What wandring, what vanity of the thoughts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, even when about his worſhipe? Do we not ordinarly worſhip him, as one taking up a ſtarr through a proſpect, who hath an ſhaking arme, ſometymes he hath a glance of it, and preſently loſeth it again? Who prayes as if they were making interceſſion for their life? or hears as the hungry man eats his meats or ſings making a melody in their hearts to the Lord? are we not then outſtriped in fervency?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They preferred the worſhipe of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35410:30"/>their Gods to their deareſt and ſweeteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, Jer. 35: 5. <hi>They made their Children paſs through the fire to Motech:</hi> This was a dreadful thing: <hi>Molech,</hi> as ſome writ of it, was a great image of braſſe, within which they did put their Children, and then ſet a fire round about the Image, and as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did heat and burne in it, the Mothers went about it danceing and ſinging, that they might not heare the cry of their Children; And in the 106. Pſalme, the Lord taxes Iſrael that they did imbrew their hands in their Childrens guiltleſs blood, when they offered them to the Idols of Canaan. <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us that at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> after <hi>Conſtantin</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to reigne, it was incredible to ſee what bones of thouſands of Children were to be found in ſome places of the City, who had been offered in ſacrifice; And this ſame was, as <hi>Acoſta</hi> the Jeſuit reports, frequent among the Indians in their worſhipe; Certainly, theſe parents wanted not natural affection to their young ones, yet they poſtponed that to the worſhipe of their Gods. Now compare this to the worſhipers of the true God; what mote appears not ane inſuperable mountaine in the way of his worſhip? Some will not come to the wedding becauſe he hath a yoke of oxen to look after, ſome ane wedding &amp;c. Ah! what would we hazard for his honour or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35410:30"/>worſhip? Goe we not near to the way of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> who deſyred Chriſt to depart out of their coaſts, becauſe of their ſwyne? in a word, who can ſay upon ſerious ſearch of his way, that he prefers the honour of his God to his deareſt enjoyments in the World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> they were much in dependance on their Gods in every thing they could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in; If they were at ſea, they had a God to looke to and depend on for ſafty; of their cornes they had a God to depend on for fruitfulneſs; of their wyns a God for that. The Romans went never out to any wart but they multiplied ſacrifices in their Capitol; if they had the victory, they eyed their Gods for it, as the Philiſtins who brought the Ark with ſongs to the Temple of Dagon, and ſet it up there as Dagons captive; compare this with our way to the true God, doe we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God in all our wayes, that he way bring it to paſſe? or do we in every thing make our requeſts known by prayer and ſupplicatione? what a ſweet life might we leade, if every difficulty gave us an earand to him with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titione, and every outgate with a ſonge? but our way is far from this; the Lord is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes put to complain of his people thus, <hi>They ſay we are Lords, and we will come no more near thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They, to teſtify their eſteem of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35410:31"/>their Gods, did highly eſteem of the ſacred ty of ane oath. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his officials <hi>de jura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi> it is wonderful to heart a Heathen ſpeak ſo reverently of ane oath read by invocating the Name of the Gods: The Story of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> returning to <hi>Carthage,</hi> becauſe he had given his oath to returne, is well known, though he knew he ſhould be put to exquiſit tortures, if he returned, yet ere he falſified his oath made in the name of his Gods, he would return. But how litle we eſteem, either in makeing or keeping of them, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice aboundantly declare. All theſe ſix then laid togither, which I have pitched upon amongſt many I might have brought I hope ſufficiently confirme the truth of the poynt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is only one uſe I ſhall proſecut a litle from this point. Is it ſo that idolaters and worſhipers of falſe Gods, doe often outſtrype and may juſtly reprehend the worſhipers of the true God? It ſerves for lamentation and humiliation; Tell it not in Gath and publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Askelon, leaſt the Daughters of the Philiſtins rejoyce: But to us what matter lamentation is it? Eſpecially if we conſider theſe ſix things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The excellency of our God beyond theirs; Our God is the Lord who made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35410:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Earth; Our God is in Heaven, and doth whatſoever he will; who is like unto the Lord among all the Gods? Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the work of mens hands; they have ears and hear not, and eyes and ſee not: but how excellent is his name through all the earth? Now ſo excellent a God and yet worſe ſerved, how lamentable is it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our principles and ground we walk by, and whereby we are bound to pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, zealous worſhip to our God, are infalliblie ſure; all that the witt of man could imagine to demonſtrat the certainty of our principles and obligations to worſhip, we have it; the ſone comeing downe from the Fathers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and revealing our duty to us, and a voice from Heaven witneſſing to the truth of his being his beloved ſone, his being ſo ratified by ſo many properties, confirmed by ſo many miracles, ſo divine doctrine proceeding from him, as hath a clear ſtamp of a divin hand upon it. It is ridiculous to hear of the original of ſome of their Gods, to whom they offered ſacrifices, often they were the work of their own hands, or ſome of the creatures which God had made their ſervitors; now how lamentable is it we ſhould be outſtryped in worſhip then, having ſo much reaſon to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:35410:32"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If ye ſhall conſider the ſweetneſs of the duties, wherein we are called to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme worſhipe to our God. An Idol ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſorrow; what a griefe do you think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved it to be to tender-hearted mothers to imbrew their hands in the blood of their own guiltleſs Children? But the duties we are called to, make a degree of Heaven on Earth; <hi>In keeping of thy Commandements there is great reward:</hi> Not only <hi>for</hi> keeping of them, but <hi>in</hi> keeping of them. What eaſe to a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened mynd is prayer, what joy in praiſes, what refreſhing conſolations from the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God as reconciled through a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſo in all other parts of worſhip. I <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced when they ſaid unto me, let us go unto the Houſe of the Lord:</hi> now ſo ſweet dutyes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us, and yet outſtryped, how lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They never pretended to that obligation to worſhip their Gods, that we owe to ours; though they thought they gave them corne and wyne, and victory over their enemies, yet they never pretended that any of them dyed for them, to prevent their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine: But by this unſpeakably-great ty we ſtand bound to our worſhipe; when our loſs was deſperat, he was broken for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in his ſtryps we are healed; and one of the ends he had in this was, that we
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35410:32"/>might be zealous worſhipers of Him, <hi>He gave himſelf</hi> (Tit. 2.) <hi>for us, that he might pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works:</hi> And we have his Apoſtles, whom he ſent out in the World to gather a Church to him, preſſing our duties on us, on this very foundation; <hi>Ye are bought with a price, and are not your own, glorifie God in your bodies and ſouls;</hi> Now after ſuch an obligation, yet to be outſtriped, how lamentable is it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We have incouragments in our worſhip from the expectation of a farr more excellent reward, then ever they could dream of or hope for, in their Elyſian Feilds, which <hi>Seneca</hi> comforted himſelf with, when at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi> command he was cutting his veins, where he hoped to meet the ſoule of <hi>Socrates,</hi> were not only fancies, but ſuppoſe they hade been real, how low a reward were they, being compared with that excellent, exceeding great, and eternal weight of Glory? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of all that is told us of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that eare hath not heard nor eye hath not ſeen, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conſider, what God hath prepared for them that love him, and that yet we ſhould be outſtriped, how ſad is it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They never dreamed of aſſiſting influences from their Gods to help them at their owrſhipe; all they did, they did in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35410:33"/>ſtrength of inherent vertue, naturall, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. <hi>Socrates</hi> could tell that his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy made him patient and bear reproaches. And <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that his Philoſophie made him contemne riches, and delight in poverty. Ay but we have the influences of aſiſting grace ſecured to us by the word of him who cannot ly, to help us at our worſhip. If we know not how to pray, nor what to pray, the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; there is a ſpirit of faith, and a ſpirit of love, and a ſpirit of a ſound mynd; Their waters came out of broken Ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, that could hold no waters; But the rock followes us, and the rock is Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All theſe, laid togither, evidence what matter of lamentation aryſeth from this point. But that I may come to a cloſe, by what means may we come to outſtrype them in our worſhipe to the true God? Since it is ſo farr that we are outſtryped, and ſo much to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, that it ſhould be ſo, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to anſwer this.</p>
            <p>And for anſwer to it, there were ſome things helped them in their worſhip, which we are to imitat: And there are ſome things they neglected, of which we are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And by this we may come to outſtrype them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For the things they did, that we are to imitat, I shall name theſe three: 1. They
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35410:33"/>were keeped much in fear and awe of their Gods; in reference to the Heathen it will in ſome meaſure hold true, <hi>primos in orbe fecit deos timor:</hi> They were ſtill affrayed, if they neglected their worshipe, their Gods would fall upon them and be avenged of it. It is true, it is too ſervil a principle of Goſpel-worshipe; Fear should not be the pace that should make our wheels goe, it should be love; <hi>if thou love me keep my Commandments:</hi> Yet where fear is wanting, uſually worshipe is wanting alſo. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in one of his diſcourſes to <hi>Job,</hi> joyns theſe two togither, though He miſapply them to <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, <hi>Surely thou reſtraines prayer, and caſteſt off ſeare.</hi> We have need to excite us to worship oftentimes, the Argument the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le uſes in the end of the 12. of the Hebr. <hi>Let us have grace,</hi> ſayeth He, <hi>to ſerve Him with reverence, for our God is a conſumeing ſire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were much keeped to their worship by this, that they judged they had need of their Gods for every thing they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, of corne, or wyn, or water, or ſucceſs in war, or peace, or childbirth, or wiſdome or what elſe, and therefore had a God for each of them: This impreſſion would contribute much to helpe us in worship, He hath told us himſelfe, <hi>that without Him me can do nothing,</hi> and alſo He hath told us, <hi>that a man can receave nothing except
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35410:34"/>it be given him from above.</hi> If we ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that both our doing and our receaveing depended on him, our addreſſes to him could not but be more frequent and fervent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They were much heartned in their worſhip by the reſponſes they had from their Oracles; It is true, their reſponſes were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dark and ambiguous, ſo as whatever way the event fell out, the reſponſe could be made to hint at it, as Croeſus found by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, yet Hiſtories tell us that theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſes coſt the many dear and coſtly obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Certainly were we noticeing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers God gives to prayer, we ſhould have more delight in it, and ſo, more frequency and fervency in it, we think our worſhip fruitleſs, and ſo loſes heart of it; <hi>Verily he is a God that heareth prayer,</hi> but uſually we wait not for our anſwer, nor ſtands not on our watch towre to hear what he will ſay, but lyke unto a Poſt delivering a letter, cares not what become of it, if once he get it delivered. Now if we could imitat them in theſe things that keeped them to their worſhip; we might readily come to outſtryp them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add two things they omitted, which being done, makes our worſhip, not only for the nature of it, but for the manner of it, farr beyond theſe, which we are alſo to practiſe.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:35410:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though they were diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon their worſhip, yet they never dreamed of any gratious qualification in the perſon that preſented the worſhip; Natur's ledder was too low to ſcal the fort of a natural heart; But if thou can reach a change of thy eſtate, and to partake ſomewhat of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyne nature, and to be borne of water and of the Spirit, it will give thy worſhip ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther luſter; by faith <hi>Abel</hi> offered a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice then <hi>Cain; Cains</hi> was the firſt fruits alſo as well as <hi>Abels</hi> was, but <hi>Abels</hi> had the ingredient of faith that <hi>Cains</hi> wanted, and ſo was more acceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though their ſacrifices were nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and ſome of them coſtly and cruel, yet they never dreamed of a High prieſt who ſtood with incenſe in his hand, which is the prayers of the Saints. This is the great ground of a beleevers hope in Chriſt, that he ſitts a High-prieſt not only to make intereſſione for the iniquity of his holineſs, and to cover the imperfections of his worſhip, but to preſent it, and to ſecond it before the Throne of God: He knowes that broken words and groans and ſuch-like ſacrifices, performed with the incenſe of righteousneſs of ſuch a Mediator, can have acceptation; therefore to outſtrype them, put thy ſacrifice ay in Chriſts hands, pray in his name, praiſe in his name,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35410:35"/>and do all through Him, and thus thy worship will be refined and prove emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>

            <p>IN theſe words and the following, we have <hi>Johns</hi> laſt teſtimony concerning Chriſt, the occaſion of which was this, ſome of Johns Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples came to him and regrat that Chriſt was brought ſo much in credit, that John and his baptiſme was like to be deſerted, <hi>He,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to whom thou beareſt teſtimony beyond Jordan, behold he baptizeth, and all men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him.</hi> Whereto <hi>John</hi> replyes, to the end of the Chapter. 1. What Chriſt did he did it by a warrand from Heaven, <hi>A man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave nothing, except it be given him from above</hi> verſ. 27. Then 2dly, He shewes ſome conſiderable differences betwixt Chriſt and himſelf, among which one in the words read, that Chriſt was the Brydegroom and Husband of the Church, for himſelf,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35410:35"/>his joy was fulfilled to be among the <hi>Friends of the Brydgroome, who did ſtand by and hear his voice.</hi> So that in the words there be theſe two parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> One difference betwixt Chriſt and John, Chriſt is the Brydgroom of the Church, which John was not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> An argument taken from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon known cuſtome amongſt men, proveing this difference, <hi>He that hath the Bryde is the Brydgroome.</hi> The denomination of the <hi>Bryd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome</hi> being grounded in the <hi>haveing of the Bryde,</hi> and the Church being only Chriſts, none elſe could be the Brydgroome, for none elſe had the Bryde.</p>
            <p>There be two things in the words neceſſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cleared: 1. What is meant by the Brydgroome and Bryde: and 2dly, Why the relation is expreſſed in theſe termes, and not of Husband and Wyffe</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> By <hi>Brydgroome</hi> is meant Chriſt, as they that run may read, for of him the diſcourſe runs all alonge, and by the <hi>Bryde,</hi> the Church: He that will uſurpe the name of head of the Church, which even <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great called <hi>ſeeleſtum illud vocabulum,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurps Chriſts ſpecial prerogative. Though John, of all that was borne amongs women, he was the greateſt, yet thinks fitt to diſclaime it. But why is the relation betwixt Chriſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35410:36"/>and his Church expreſſed in theſe tearmes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe that made beſt for Johns purpoſe, which was to prove that Chriſt ought to have the preheminence above him in all things, ſince nature and reaſon teach men to give this to a Brydegroome, and not to his friends that ſtand by and are to attend him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The tearmes of <hi>Brydegroom</hi> and <hi>Bryde,</hi> ſuted well to expreſs the nature of the relation betwixt Chriſt and the Church. For 1. The mariage is not yet fully compleated. At the great day (Revel. 4.) the Bryde ſhall be made ready and ſhe ſhall be brought into the Palace of the King. Beſide, by this John ſhewes, that Chriſt love and affection to his Church is ſtill tender and freſh, as of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their mariage-day.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And eſpecially, by this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is ſhewed the ſweetneſs of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-fellowſhip betwixt Chriſt and his Church, which though it endure to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is ſtill as it were but beginning. How ſweet ſoever the mariage-fellowship betwix: husband and wyffe be in the continuance of their mariage, yet there is not alwayes ſuch feaſting and mirth, as on the mariage-day; but here the husband is ſtil in his mariage-robs, and the Bryde in hers, and the feaſt and mirth of the wedding-day ſtill as they were but beginning, and they are both ſtill as Bryd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom and Bryde.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:35410:36"/>
            <p>There be ſeveral pertinent obſervations to the preſent occaſion, ariſing out of theſe words, but I shall only take one general, and follow it a little.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. <hi>That there is a mariage-relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and beleevers;</hi> He is the <hi>Brydegroom,</hi> and they are the <hi>Bryde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This point, as it is clear here, ſo it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſerted in other Scriptures, Pſal. 45. all throughout, in a type of the mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Solomon and Pharohs Daughter, the ſame mariage is expreſſed, there we have the Brydegroom in ſtate, all his garments ſmelled of mirrhe and aloes and caſſia, and the Bryde in rayment of needle-work, brought unto the King. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54: 5. The Lord comforts his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people there, with the repreſentation of this mariage, <hi>Thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and no more remember the reproach of thy widdowhoode, for thy maker is thy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Lord of Hoſts is his name.</hi> The ſame we have the Apoſtle aſſerting Rom. 7: 4. for for ye are maried unto another, that ye may bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this point we shall follow this method, 1. Inquire a little in this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of a mariage betwixt Chriſt and beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. 2dly, Enquire how can there be ſuch a mariage, eſpecially parties; and 3dly, Shall apply it.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:35410:37"/>
            <p>For the 1. of theſe, there is nothing more ſutable for a mariage-feaſt, then to be inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the nature of the mariage, neither do we ſtretch the allegory beyond its ſcope, when we find theſe four betwixt Chriſt and beleevers implyed in this mariage betwixt Chriſt and his Church. 1. A near and a firme union, which in mariage hath not a paralel. 2. Intimat fellowſhip and communion which reſults likewayes from mariage. 3. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſeveral duties of their ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their maried relation. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal communicating of what belongs unto the one party unto the other. All theſe four are in a mariage, and all four concurre in this mariage betwixt Chriſt and his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is an union betwixt them, which though it be myſtical, yet ceaſes not therefore to be real, it is frequently expreſſed in Scripture by ſimilitudes taken from the union of the head and members, root and branches, fundation and building; but that which I am to evidence is, that it is the nature of a mariage-union, and there be two properties of it will evidence this. 1. In the Scripture wee find the union of many relations joyned togither to expreſs this union alone, take one place for all, Mark. 3. <hi>v.</hi> laſt. <hi>For whoſoever shall do the will of God, the ſame is my brother, my ſiſter, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35410:37"/>my mother.</hi> How nearly are they united, that are ſtated in all theſe relations, as brother, ſiſter, and mother? He that doth the will of God, is ſo to Chriſt. Beſide 2dly, The union betwixt Chriſt and his Church is not only nearer then that which is betwixt him and ſtanding Angels, he haveing united the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane natur to the divine; But it is nearer then that which was between God and Adam. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyns ſay, that betwixt God and Adam there was <hi>ſoedus amicitiae,</hi> but not <hi>foedus conjugale,</hi> there ws ſuch an union, while he ſtood, as is betwixt two who are intimatly friends. But this is <hi>foedus conjugale,</hi> where the union is ſo near that the Church is not only called the Bryde of Chriſt, or the body of Chriſt which is nearer, but ſometimes gets the name of Chriſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12:12. <hi>For as the body is one and hath many members, and all the members are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt:</hi> A ſtrange name to be given to the Church, <hi>ſo alſo is Chriſt;</hi> but ſo near is the union, that the Church hath the very name <hi>Chriſt</hi> given to it: Is not this then a mariage-union? But if we ſhall in the 2d place add to this, the firmeneſs of the union; neither adultery, nor death can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it, which uſually looſe the mariage-union. Not adultery, Jer. 3: 1. <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers,</hi> and yet in the 14. <hi>Turne backſliding Children, for I am maried unto
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35410:38"/>you:</hi> the mariage not diſſolved, no not for adultery. Yea, death does not diſſolve it; <hi>The woman,</hi> layeth the Apoſtle Rom. 7: 2. <hi>is bound by the Law to her Husband, while the Husband liveth, but if the Husband be dead, she is looſed;</hi> but here death looſeth not the law of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, Revel. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord,</hi> as they truſted in the Lord and walked in him, and delighted in him, ſo <hi>they die in him,</hi> yea whither they live or die, ſtill they are the Lords; ſo that the union is a mariage-union.</p>
            <p>We come 2dly to ſhew the intimat fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion, which concurs to make up this mariage, and which is the 2d thing we propoſed from the allegory. It is true though the mariage-union be even in this life as firme and ſure as ever it will or can be, yet the mariage-communion is farr from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it ſhall have; there is notwithſtanding real communion betwixt them, <hi>Truely our fellowship is with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 1: 3. <hi>Truely,</hi> it is not then a fancy, and that <hi>truly</hi> there is ſuch a mariage-fellowſhip betwixt them, is evident, among many things, from theſe <hi>two,</hi> 1. Their neer converſing togither. 2dly, Familiar commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of ſecrets one to another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their familiar converſing togither, which in the Scripture is holden out, in theſe &amp; ſuch like expreſſions, of <hi>walking with them,</hi> of <hi>dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35410:38"/>in them,</hi> in <hi>comeing to them,</hi> and <hi>ſupping with them &amp; they with him,</hi> of <hi>rejoycing over them to do them good, as the Brydegroom rejoyceth over the Bryde;</hi> and if all theſe be too little to expreſs it, he putts them in his <hi>boſome, Iſai,</hi> 40.11. the Lambs that are not able to walk, <hi>he puts them in his boſome.</hi> Doth not all theſe, laid togither, evince a free &amp; a familiar converſing togither.</p>
            <p>But if we ſhall add to this, the 2d, the free and familiar commutation of ſecrets, <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> and the Spirit of the Lord. Chriſt can tell his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, John 15 I <hi>call you not Servants but Friends,</hi> becauſe he had put them ſo farr on his <hi>ſecrets</hi> which uſually is not done to meer Servants. I <hi>have told you all,</hi> ſayes he, I <hi>have heard of my father.</hi> Is there not here a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſecrets, upon Chriſts pairt? The like is alſo upon the Churchs, <hi>David</hi> puts it in one of his Pſalmes, <hi>All my complaint is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi> My groaning, there are many things wee groan for, that we would tell none on earth; But my groaning is not hide from thee. Is there not then here a mutual commutation of ſecrets? There be many other things wherein communion betwixt Chriſt and his Church conſiſts, but thir two tend moſt to prove a marriage-communion, their familiar converſe togither, and their ſpiritual commutatione of ſecrets. I go to the 3d.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:35410:39"/>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, if we ſhall conſider, for conſtituting this marriage, their mutual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duties of this relation; we find them in Scripture propoſed as paterns to all that are in mariage relations: <hi>Husbands love your wyves, as Chriſt hath loved his Church,</hi> and <hi>Wyves be ſubject to your husbands, as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt.</hi> The love, which is the ſumme of the husbands duty, upon his part, Eph. 3. <hi>Paſſeth knowledge,</hi> thee can no love be found to reſemble it, but one, John 15. <hi>as the Father hath loved me, ſo have</hi> I <hi>loved you;</hi> how lovingly ſpeaks he to the Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſong, uſually in ſuch termes as theſe, <hi>My love, my dove, my fair one:</hi> and on the other part, the Church is ſubject unto him, ſhe obeyes him even as <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and called him Lord: That is true, the obedience is imperfect, and hath many craks into it, yet she <hi>eſteems all his commandments, concerning every thing, to be right,</hi> and He graciouſly accepts of the will in ſtead of the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> There is in this mariage a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal commutation of what belongs to the one party unto the other: 1. Upon Chriſts part, it is impoſſible to enumerat all the particular Jewels, far leſs the high inheritance, that is given the Church by Him; we muſt reſt upon that the Apoſtle hath, 1 Cor. 3. towards the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35410:39"/>end, <hi>all things are yours, and ye are Chriſts,</hi> all things <hi>preſent,</hi> and things <hi>to come,</hi> amongſt the reſt, <hi>death</hi> is yours, it is no longer your enemy, but your ſervant, for ye are Chriſts. Now whatſoever may be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>all things,</hi> He communicats to his Church. It is true the Church hath nothing to give him. Let Pelagians talke of their preventing God, and Papiſts of their merit, and of their ſupererogating, what they will, beleevers know their goodneſs extends not unto him, Only ſhe gives <hi>herſelfe,</hi> and ſhe gives <hi>her debt.</hi> 1. She gives herſelf, the Apoſtle commends this in the Macedonians, that <hi>they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Lord.</hi> And 2. their dept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his he payes it, and diſcharges their debt, <hi>the hand writting of ordinances which was againſt them,</hi> and contrary to them, <hi>by nailing it unto the Croſs.</hi> Thus we have briefly ſhewed wherein this mariage conſiſts.</p>
            <p>The 2d thing we propoſed is, how can ſuch a mariage be poſſible, eſpecially conſidering the vaſt odds betwixt the parties. For clearing this, I shall briefly ſay only theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Beleevers in their eternal election are given to Chriſt by his Father, it is true, we know but little of the manner and way of the eternal transactions betwixt the father and ſone; and ſome are too bold with Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in determining herein: that is ſufficient
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35410:40"/>to our purpoſe, to know that the father hath from all eternity made a gift of his elect unto Chriſt, and in this is laid the firſt foundation of their mariage-union and communion; <hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me,</hi> and again, of <hi>all that the Father hath given me, I have loſt none:</hi> ſo that whatever they be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves yet ſince they are the fathers gift, in their election, there is in this a foundation laid for a mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The love of Chriſt, however it be high in regarde of the perſon loving, yet withall it is very condeſcending in reference to the thing loved, yea the more condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be and the leſs attracted by any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the object, the more of the nature of pure love there is into it, <hi>amor purus,</hi> ſaid Bernard, <hi>non eſt mercenarius.</hi> His love then being altogither free, (hence it is ſtouping) can and does very well condeſcend to beſtow this higheſt love-relation upon baſeſt wormes: even ſo great a God to love with ſuch a great love ſuch as we. Now from the love which is pure love proceeds this mariage, and who can hinder his love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How low ſoever our naturs be in regard of creation, being made a little lower then the Angels, yet not a little advanced above the angelical nature, by reaſon of the perſonal union of the humane nature, with
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35410:40"/>the divin in the perſon of the Mediator, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man haveing ſit down at the right hand of the Father, <hi>to which of the Angels ſaid he at any tyme, Sit thou down at my right hand. Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus</hi> in his mariage with <hi>Eſther</hi> did make her no more noble in blood then ſhe was before: But in this Brydegroom, this is ſingular, that he hes lifted up the nature of his Bryde in the union of the ſame nature with the divine, it is nothing ſo ſtrange then there be a mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As for the <hi>moral</hi> diſtance betwixt Chriſt and his Bryde, this is alſo removed by waſhing her in his own blood. It is needleſs to debar whither our union with Chriſt or out juſtification preceed in order of natur, ſince in order of tyme the odds cannot be great. But we are all waſhen before our mariage-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, and as Eſther, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with the incenſe of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus the Brydegroom: Now lay theſe four togither, and the mariage, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the waſt odds betwixt the parties, will not appear ſo ſtrange. But I go to the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a threefold uſe we ſhall follow from this point. Is there ſuch a mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and beleevers? Then let all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and praiſe the Brydegroom for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable condeſcendency; <hi>thy Maker is thy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35410:41"/>Husband,</hi> are words of wonder; there be theſe things that make the mariage truely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The majeſty and greatneſs of the Brydegroom. The Apoſtle forbidds us to be unequaly yoked, but how unequaly is he yoked, the brightneſs of the Fathers glory, the expreſs image of his perſon, he that thinks it no robbery to be equal with God, the man that is his fellow, whom all the Angels adore, thus to condeſcend how admirable is it?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially if in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place we conſider the baſeneſs of the Bryde: Might not the Church ſay as <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> when he ſent to take her in mariage, 1 Sam. 24: 4. <hi>Behold let thine Handmaid be a ſervant to wash the feet of the Servants of my Lord:</hi> How baſe and polluted are we, and yet admitted to ſuch a mariage, and taken into his boſome!</p>
            <p>If <hi>thirdly,</hi> We conſider how earneſtly he ſuited us, and how many repulſes he indured, before he could gain our conſent! How oft he did ſtand at the door and knock till his locks were wet with the dew of the night! How oft did he put in his hand at the hole of the door, and his fingers dropped myrrhe! How oft did he intreat, beſeech, alure with promiſes, and yet we greived his Spirit, deſpiſed it, quenched it! How oft was he made to ſit down and weep over us, as he
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35410:41"/>did over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Oh! if that thou in this day had known the things that belong to thy peace!</hi> How oft hes he pyped unto us, and we have not danced, and mourned unto us and we not lamented!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider the admirable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges we are advanced to, by this mariage, the Church in the 2d of Hoſea after ſhe hes tryed all other lovers, verſ. 7. <hi>I will go and return to my firſt husband, for then it was better with me then it is now.</hi> How noble a Husband, and how ſure an inheritance! What ſweetneſs of content in fellowſhip with him! <hi>I ſat down under his shaddow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte,</hi> ſayes the ſpouſe, in the ſong; the halfe of the truth cannot be told of the greatneſs of this priviledge, and how much, eſpecially at the mariage-feaſt, ought we to be admiring it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> uſe, If there be ſuch a mariage, labour Chriſtian to attaine it, this is that we have in commiſſion to offer to thee: Miniſters are ſent out, as Eleazar Abrahams ſervant, to ſeek a Wyff to their Maſters Sone; do not deſpiſe thy own mercy. If thou ask what ſhall thou do in order to thy cloſing with it; <hi>I</hi> ſhall offer the theſe helpes briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou muſt renounce all treating with thy other lovers, with whom either thou haſt contracted or art about to contract a mariage,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35410:42"/>thou cannot be maried to both; <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creatur, and old things are past away.</hi> Thy drunkenneſs, ſwearing, ſabboth-breaking, carleſs walking, hypocriſy, or what elſe, it is but adultery thou committeſt with them. The man whom now thou hes is not thy husband, ſaid Chriſt to the woman at the well. Stand not at it, to give up with theſe, the bargan we drive the day, is like to a mother who offers her Child an apple to quit the knyff, he hath in his hand, that would cutt his fingers. What ever promiſes theſe lovers make, thou will come in the end to ſay of them as Poets fable <hi>Ariadne</hi> ſaid of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Theſeus</hi> when he left her deſolat and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in an Iland of the Sea, <hi>Mitius inveni quam tegenus omne ferarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2dly, If thou will attain this mariage, hearken to his wooeing-motions, I shall in this, name but two or three ſteps of his proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in his fuit of mariage, and ſee how thou carieſt to him in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Poſſibly the Lord by his ordinances darts in ſome beames of light into thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſo that thou who was formerly ane ignorant, comes by it to ſee the evil of ſome ſinns thou hath delighted in, or canſt diſcourſe rationally of ſome truths of the Goſpel thou waſt ignorant of, take Heed how thoug hes this candle of the Lord lighted in thy boſſome;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35410:42"/>If thou continue in that ſin after it, or only pryde thy ſelf in thy knowledge, thou hes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of his wooeing-motions. He hath been ſtanding at the door knocking, and thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hes been, I have put off my coat how shall <hi>I</hi> put it on? And, that thou was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to continue a-bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Readily Chriſt proceeds farther in his ſuit, by his Spirit fortifying the light in the underſtanding, and makeing it ſet the conſcience in fyre with the ſenſe of ſin, and the apprehenſione of wrath; this is one of his wayes of wooing, how unſuitable ſoever it appear at firſt to mariage-love. Now ſee how thou caries to this, take heed where thou brings watter to quench this fyre, if thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, or like Saul take an Inſtrument of muſick to cure it, and dar not entertain it till thou get water drawen out of the wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thou extinguishes one of his wooing-motions.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>thirdly,</hi> if he go farther yet in his ſuit, and ſtirr in thy affections ſome deſire after Chriſt, thou ſayeſt from the commendations thou heareſt of him, O if he were mine! But readily to morrow when the Sacrament is by, thou lookeſt on it as a man will doe on a bargane he made in his drunkenneſs, rew it, and do what he can, to caſt it again; this is to deſpiſe the mariage. In a word learn care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35410:43"/>to intertaine his ſuit. Many, eſpecially at Sacraments, are like ſome leafy ſervants on whom in the morning their Maſter calls, and they anſwer <hi>coming,</hi> and falls a ſleep again, and if he call again the ſecond tyme, the ſame anſwer, but falls aſleep again; this in his wooing is his entertainment, He ſayes in his ordinances <hi>aryſe my love, my dove, my fair one, and come away,</hi> for this is not thy reſt: We anſwer at the ordinances while the cry laſts, <hi>coming,</hi> and then falls aſleep again; this is to deſpyſe the mariage.</p>
            <p>Theſe three helpes I have given you to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this mariage; doe not ſtand diſputing thy unworthineſs or thy unſuitableneſs to this mariage, at leaſt caſt not at it becauſe thou art not his match: <hi>Abigail</hi> judged her ſelf bad enough to waſh the feet of the Servants of <hi>David,</hi> yet ſhe ryſes and goes with the ſervants of <hi>David,</hi> to take him to her Husband. <hi>What if God willing to shew mercy on the veshels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>who art thou O man that replyeſt to God.</hi> If he offer the a mariage and his offer is ſincere, it becomes not thee to charge him with imprudency, call thy ſelf as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy as thou will, yet with <hi>Abigail</hi> up and goe with the meſſengers, &amp; accept of the mariage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Uſe,</hi> Is it ſo that there is a mariage betwixt Chriſt and his Church, then in the third place, let ſuch as have attained this high
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35410:43"/>priviledge learn to improve it, eſpecially in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thou may come with confidence and cheerfulneſs to his table in this ordinance of the Sacrament: the Maſter of this Feaſt is thy eſpouſed Husband, as he that hath the apple tree hath a compleat right to all the fruit that growes upon it; this is one part of the mariage-communion, which refults from the mariage-union. He ſayes to thee, take eat this is my body which is broken for you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By vertue of this mariage thou haſt an excellent anſwer to all intyſeing tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thou can tell the tempter in his ſuit, thou art already maried, and what hath he to do to entyſe anothers Wyff. <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> could not indure to ſee Haman falling on the Bed of Queen <hi>Eſther:</hi> What will he force the Queen before mine eyes, ſaid he. Thy husband is a jealous God, tell this to the tempter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thy being clothed with this Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band affoords the ane eaſy way how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage any thing above thy ſtrength; put it over upon him, thou art to do as <hi>Manoahs</hi> Wyfe did when the Angel came to her and told her of the birth of Sampſon, <hi>Stay,</hi> ſayes ſhe, <hi>till I call my Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome ſay, there is no queſtion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragments a new reſulting from this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: But I doubt if indeed I be married
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35410:44"/>unto him; take then ſome marks to try it by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If thy marriage-love be only reſerved for him; A woman may love her children, friends, and, with ſome kind of love, her poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but her mariage-love ought only to be reſerved for her Husband, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>There is none on earth that I deſire befide thee,</hi> the <hi>benſil</hi> of thy love is for him, and other things loved with a reference to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How does thou take with his abſence? is it thy affliction or not, Matth. 9. <hi>Can the children of the mariage chamber mourne ſo long as the Brydegroom is with them, but the day shall come, he shall be taken from them, then they shall faſt;</hi> does thy joy eb and flow with his preſence, and abſence? this is a good ſymptome he is thine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Try it by thy ſubjection to his lawes. The woman is bound by the law of the Husband, ſo longe as the Husband liveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:2. by his being a Husband he ceaſes not therefor to be a Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>For He is thy Lord and worshipe thou him:</hi> The more love, the more obedience: <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements;</hi> Its not ſome flaſh of a deſire after him at ſuch a time as this, will prove a mariage, but where there is a conſtant tract of obedience to him as a Lord, there is a ſweet proof of his being thy Husband. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the entry of this Chapter, we have the Lord comforting Iſrael, who were hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that ever they ſhould return out of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> by nameing <hi>Cyrus</hi> an hundreth years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his birth, whoſe <hi>right hand he would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> and that they might the better beleeve, that notwithſtanding all the power of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians, Cyrus</hi> ſhould deliver, the Lord tells them, He had done greater things then that came to, <hi>He formed the light,</hi> verſ. 7. and verſ. 18. <hi>He formed the earth and eſtablished it;</hi> this incouragment continues from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chapter to the 22. verſ. from thence to the end of the Chapter, we have a prophecy of the calling in of the Gentils, <hi>Look unto me all ye ends of the earth and be ſaved;</hi> and in the words read we have the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the beleeving Gentils when they ſhall be called in; they ſhall find <hi>in the Lord righteouſneſs and ſtrength,</hi> and in this they ſhall triumph and <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:35410:45"/>
            <p>This being the ſcop of the words. In them theſe three particulars are conſiderable. 1. A compend of the priviledges of the beleeving Gentils, <hi>righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> 2. The fountain of the priviledges, <hi>In the Lord.</hi> 3. The triumphe the Gentils ſhall make becauſe of their priviledge, <hi>Surely shall one ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things in them are neceſſary to be cleared: 1. What is meant by <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſtrength.</hi> 2dly, What is implyed in theſe words, <hi>Shall one ſay.</hi> For the 1. Some referr the two only to times of trial, making them to relat to captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be, in the Lord I ſhall find righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſupporting ſtrength, and faithful deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under the captivity. But with <hi>Calvin,</hi> we take the words as the priviledge of the Gentils, who ſhould come to Chriſt, and ſo (as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves) comprehend the two main points of our ſalvation, ſtrength in Chriſt, and righteouſneſs, for covering our defects, in Chriſt. For the <hi>other,</hi> what is implyed in, <hi>shall one ſay:</hi> It imports a triumph, and glorying in theſe priviledges, as uſually the like expreſſion imports in this prophecie, <hi>In that day shall ye ſay,</hi> 12. Chapt. So that the whole meaning of the words comes to this, that when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils ſhould look to Chriſt they ſhould triumph in their condition, becauſe of the righteouſneſs and ſtrength they ſhould find in him. There be ſeveral Obſervations we might take notice
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35410:45"/>of from the words, but I ſhall only pitch upon one, and proſecut it in this Sermon.</p>
            <p>Obſervat. <hi>That the ſtrength whereby beleevers act in duties, and the righteouſneſs whereby the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of their dueties is covered, are both to be found in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This point is clear from the words, the bleeving Gentils, who look to him and are ſaved, triumph in this, that they find <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſtrength in him.</hi> In proſecuting of it we shall take the doctrine in two parts. 1. Shall shew that our ſtrength for duties, is in Chriſt: and 2dly, That the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that covers the defects of our duties, is alſo to be found in him.</p>
            <p>For the 1. that the ſtrength whereby we performe duties, is in Chriſt: we ſhall 1. prove it from Scripture. 2dly, Give ſome grounds of it. 3dly, Apply it. For the proofe of it from Scripture, there be theſe things in the Scripture, that tend to confirme it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Scripture every where declares man utterly impotent for performing the meaneſt duety without God. If he be called to will, it is <hi>God that muſt worke it in him;</hi> If to do, it muſt proceed from the ſame God, Philip. 2: 13. If to pray, <hi>the Spirit muſt help our infirmities,</hi> Rom, 8. If to hear, He muſt <hi>awaken our ear,</hi> Iſai. 50: Yea what ever we do, there is nothing of it we are able to doe of our-ſelves, no not of ourſelvs to think ſo much as that that is good.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, What duties we are comanded to doe, we are expreſly commanded to do them in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35410:46"/>ſtrength of Chriſt. If to reſiſt tentations, we are to be <hi>ſtrong in the Lord and the power of his might,</hi> Epheſ. 6: 11. If to walk according to the rules of the Goſpel; <hi>we are to walk in him,</hi> Coloſſ. 2: 12. If to hope, he moſt <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the heart,</hi> Pſal. 27. <hi>Laſt.</hi> If to carry a right under deſertions, we muſt <hi>truſt in the name of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 42: 6. and laſt. If fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in any duty, we <hi>muſt abyd in him as the branch in the root,</hi> John 15: 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is evident alſo from the names that Chriſt hath given unto him in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as, Our <hi>lyfe,</hi> Col. 3: 4. Our <hi>light,</hi> Pſ. 27: 1. Our <hi>hope,</hi> Coloſſ. 1: 27. Our <hi>root,</hi> John 15: 4. Our <hi>conſolation,</hi> Luke 2: 19. Our <hi>wiſdom,</hi> our <hi>ſanctification,</hi> all which prove the truth of the point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the Scripture the Saints have aſcribed the praiſe of whatſoever they have, either of active or paſſive obedience to him. If they ſuffer patiently, <hi>I can do all things through him that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Philipp. 4: v. 13. If they act in their duty, <hi>Not I, but the grace of God in me,</hi> ſayes Paul. Yea if they perſever, <hi>thy right hand upholdeth me,</hi> Pſal. 63: 8. Yea the praiſe of their life to him, I <hi>live, not I, but Chriſt that lives in me,</hi> Gal. 2: 20. All theſe laid togither prove aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Scripture, that our ſtrength for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is in Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:35410:46"/>
            <p>As for the grounds of it, why the Lord hath put our ſtrength in the hand of Chriſt, and not in our own, I ſhall name but theſe four.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By this, our ſtrength under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace is ſurer laid up, then it was under the Covenant of works: once our ſtrength for works was in our own hands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, though the perfecteſt meer man that ever was, both for moral and gratious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duements, yet how ſoon did he make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrak of it! Yea the patrons of univerſal grace, who aſſert that God hath given ſufficient grace to men for attaining ſalvation, can neitehr ſay that it would be effectual for ſalvation, or that it is not often loſt, without the influences of aſſiſting grace: but by this way of making Chriſt the fountaine of ſtrength, our ſtrength is put into the hand of one who can not change, who is one and the ſame yeſterday, and the day, and for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt his becoming our ſtrength for duties, ſuits well to the great deſigne of the Goſpel, which is the advancing of his own glory: For 1. This tends to keep up his peoples dependence upon him; This makes a thick court of ſupplicants, which is much for the honour of a Prince. If we had a ſtock of grace in our hand, we would readily ſay, as Iſrael did, <hi>We are Lords and will come no more
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35410:47"/>near thee.</hi> He that hath riches enough of his own, deſpyſeth begging; and he that hath health enough, ſeeks not after a phiſitian. It is true there is inherent grace given, in ef\fectual calling, to beleevers: But it is as ane ſpark of fyre in greenwood, which, if it be not continually blown upon, it would dye out; whither Adam needed the influences of aſſiſting grace, notwithſtanding of all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent grace, is to me beyond controverſy: Neither did it derogat from the perfection of his eſtat. But that we conſtantly need it, and ought to be ſtill dependent for it, who will deny? 2dly, As this dependence is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for God, ſo by putting our ſtrength for duties in Chriſts hand, his people hes ſtill freſh and new matter of praiſes: Every new enlargement of heart for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance affoords thee ſubject of a new ſonge, and thus He is ſtill glorified by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> our ſtrength being in the hand of Chriſt, tends not only to advance the honour of Chriſt, but our obedience in the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are eminently advanced by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſtrength in Chriſts hand, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>ſelf-denyal.</hi> 1 This way makes a great deal of work for faith, eſpecially as we live by faith a lyfe of ſanctification, every branch of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35410:47"/>holyneſs calls for ane new act of faith; not only is faith to be acted in order to the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our duty, but for ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; and this eminently promoves ſelf-denyal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, when there is moſt inlargement of heart in duties, we muſt remember it is dereived from ane-other; there is a remarkable word, Deuter. 8. <hi>He fed them in the wilderneſs with Manna, which thy Fathers knew not, that he might hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them.</hi> How could this humble them? Was it not Angels food? But it was food He behoved to give them dayly, and this tended to humble them. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſoever the influences of grace from Chriſt be, yet ſince there is freſh need of them dayly, this tends to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This putting our ſtrength in Chriſts hand makes Chriſts yoke both eaſier and ſweeter to his people, then if their ſtrength were in their own hand. 1. It makes it eaſier. If a Father ſhall undertake to pay his ſons expence at every taverne he comes to, its more eaſy nor if he had given him money in his purſe to pay for himſelfe. We have no more to doe now, but ask and it will be given us, and knock and it ſhall be opened unto us. Iſrael had more eaſe in getting their food in the wilderneſs, nor they had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35410:48"/>when they tilled and ſowed for it in their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> poſſeſſions; they had here no more to do, but gather what was rained down to them. It makes his yoake alſo ſweeter, then if our ſtrength were in our hand. <hi>My beloved put in his hand a the hole of the door, and his fingers dropped myrrhe,</hi> that which drops from his fingers, it hath to his ſpouſe the reliſh of myrrhe; that he as our nurſe muſt pout our meat in our mouth, and that we are to be ſtrong i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the grace that is in Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſweeteſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It were very pertinent with the point to enter here with <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who of old did talk ſo much of mans being able by the power of natural qualifications to prevent God, and merit the firſt graces from God by a merit of congruity: againſt whom, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> among the Fathers, and profound <hi>Bradwardin</hi> in his Book, <hi>De cauſa Dei,</hi> have written at great length; the Patrons of univerſal grace, <hi>Papiſts, Arminians,</hi> who alſo are at beſt <hi>Semi-pelagians,</hi> in oppoſing the truth, extolling man to the diſhonour of Chriſt: but how pextinent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this were to the point, the unſuitableneſs of it to the preſent occaſion ſhall make me wave it, and come to the practick application of the point.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is it ſo that our ſtrength for duties
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35410:48"/>is put in the hand of Chriſt; in the firſt place, take heed of making the wrong uſe of it, as if no attempt were to be made at duties, but when we had actual influences of ſtrength from Chriſt; how frequent is this? Eſpecially at Sacraments; How can I ſail without wind? Or can ſuch a lame ones as I walk, If I be not borne? To obviat this I ſhall offer theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our <hi>obligation</hi> to duties remains, though Chriſt ſhould withdraw ſtrengthening influences of grace; our impotency is much acquired, and God loſeth not his right to require obedience, though we have loſt our ſtrength to perform it, a creditor hath ſufficient right in law to crave his debt, though the debitor hath deboſhed away all his eſtat, and thereby becomes incapacitat to pay him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> we may do much as to the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of duties, even under a deſertion, though the actual influences of grace be ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary for the gracious qualifications of them; there is yet more in our power, yea even ſuppoſe in an unregenerat eſtate, farr more when only under a deſertion and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſting grace, then we do; yea uſually aſſiſting grace is given when we are active in exerting and ſtirring up inherent grace, Pſal. 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt, <hi>Wait on the Lord and be of good

Often we complain of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35410:49"/>the want of what we are enjoying, <hi>Solom. Song</hi> cap. 4. verſ. <hi>laſt.</hi> the Church prayes, <hi>Let my beloved come to his garden, my ſiſter my ſpouſe;</hi> ſhe ſpeaks of him as abſent, but He tells here be is preſent, ſome men will ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their hatt when it is upon their head; and you may have ſtrength and not diſcern it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Suppoſe he ſhould deny thee ſtrength to act in thy duty: not only art thou a debitor to him for obedience, and he is none to thee for aſſiſting grace: But alſo thou ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſearch, what it may be that impeds his ſtrengthening influences. We are often like orped children, that, when the fathers frown on them, fret at their condition, but conſider not their fault; poſſibly thou hes abuſed aſſiſtance formerly given, quenched and grevied his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But I come to the two <hi>Uſes</hi> of the point, having guarded againſt the abuſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Uſe,</hi> Is our ſtrength in Chriſt? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves theſe who ſet about duties in their own ſtrength. It is ane excellent reſolution of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 71: 16. <hi>I will goe in the ſtrength of the Lord, and make mention of his righteouſneſs, even of his only.</hi> There be theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which ariſe from our performing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in our own ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This makes many empty reſolutions: When we hear of duties in preaching of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35410:50"/>Goſpel, preſently, at ſuch occaſions eſpecally, we reſolve to beleive, to conſent, to walk more watchfully, and doth not eye Chriſt for ſtrength: This is to bring butt the thing thats not there-ben. Can any gather graps off thornes, or figgs off thiſles, or can that which is pure, proceed from that which is impure? This proves nothing, but clouds without rain.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The forgetting this makes the work of God a burden to us, we ſtryve to wring our performance out of our own hearts; which are as dry hearbs, that have not the juice in them. We ſeek; and thus we toyle and wreſtle like one lifting a burden above his ſtrength: whereas if Chriſt were eyed for ſtrength, his yoke would be eaſy, and his Commandements not grievous. They that wait thus on the Lord ſhall mount up as the eagle, they ſhall run and not be weary, and walk and not be faint.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The neglecting of this produces a yeelding to every light <hi>tentation;</hi> we fooliſhly encounter it in our own ſtrength, who art thou ſaid <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David</hi> a ſtripling, and he a man of warr from his youth. <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord</hi> and in the power of his might, is the firſt part of the rule Paul gives for reſiſting of tentations.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, The forgetting this makes our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices unacceptable to God, and fruitleſs to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35410:50"/>ourſelves, as God reliſhes no ſervice, but what proceeds from his own ſpirit; ſo it is beſt, and here, In his own ſtrength ſhall no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Amongſt other things imported in that whatſoever ye ask in my name, this is one, in my ſtrength, it is a ſad challenge Chriſt hath againſt even his own Diſciples, hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The not eyeing Chriſt for ſtrength weakneth our confidence in our approaches to God: If we could ſay as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 27. <hi>Thou ſaid unto me, Week ye my face,</hi> our next word with very much confidence might be, <hi>Hyd not thy face from me.</hi> If a King endyt his ſubjects petition himſelf, the ſubject may be little feared, it ſhall be granted. The caſe is ſo here, when Chriſt is our ſtrength in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he as it were endyts our petitions, and will he reject the bill he penned.</p>
            <p>Ane other <hi>Uſe</hi> of the point; is our ſtrength in Chriſt, then make uſe of him for ſtrength; <hi>Tell me,</hi> ſaid Dalilah to Sampſon, <hi>where thy great ſtrength lyeth.</hi> Know him for thy ſtrength, and make uſe of him as ſuch, many ſeek their righteouſneſs in him, that ſeek in themſelves their ſtrength.</p>
            <p>If thou ſhalt ask what ſhalt thou do in gett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtrength forth coming to thee? take ſhortly theſe rules to help thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Often lay before him thy inherent
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35410:51"/>weakneſs and inſufficiency for thy work, as <hi>David</hi> did often in his Pſalms, <hi>Hear me O God for I am weak.</hi> Doe thou as thoſe who would have their Cloathes dryed, they ſpread them out before the ſun, and there comes heat from the ſun that dryes them; ſpread thy weakneſs before Him, this was the courſe the poor, blind, lame, took in the Goſpel: They did caſt themſelves in his way with their blind eyes and lame leggs; he is no leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionat now, then he was then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Labour to propoſe right ends in thy deſyrs of ſtrength from him: Doe not as <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> who would have had the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt that he might become ſome great man. Our ſtrength for duties is given, as noble-men gives their pages livray-cloathes, that by them their maſters may be honoured, not they; of him and for him are all things, to him be praiſe, ſayes the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Take notice of the ordinary way how he uſeth to communicat ſtrength to his people. I ſay the <hi>ordinar way,</hi> for there are many wayes He takes in his communicating influences to his people, but the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way is, to make ſomething look out of a promiſe, after reading ſome part of his word, which readily they have often read, but never diſcerned that into it before, as the old blind
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35410:51"/>man who had a boy reading to him, the 8th Chapter to the Romans, and hearing the 1. <hi>verſe</hi> of it, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Hold, ſaid he, I have often read, often preached, on that verſe, but now I perceive ſomething in it I never ſaw before, and was filled with ſuch joy, as he profeſſed he never felt the like in his life; It is very remarkable in Scripture, ſometimes we will find the word which hath leſs aptitude to convert, ſometimes have greater effect then that which hath a great deall more, as, to <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> 1 John, the word that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>behold ane Iſraelit indeed, in whom there is no guile,</hi> does not convert <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,</hi> though that was a ſure proofe of Chriſts being God, that he could ſay ſo much, but ane other word, leſs apt, does it; I <hi>ſaw thee under the figg tree,</hi> thou art the Son of God, ſayes <hi>Nathaniel.</hi> wait till he make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing look out to thee, of ſome part of his word, and poſſibly even that thou thinks leaſt of may be the chariot that conveyeth thy ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Be following thy duty with the ſtrength thou haſt till more come; It is the Lords way to give his people ſtrength when about their duty; <hi>I went downe to the garden, to ſee if the pomagranats buded, ere I was aware, my ſoul was as the Chariots of Aminadab.</hi> If
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35410:52"/>thou ſhall ſay, thou reads, prays, hears &amp;c. and finds nothing conveyed by theſe from Chriſt to thee: Chriſtian! doe it again, yea ſo long as there ſtands a command for doing of it, be doing it ſtill; remember the anſwer Peter gave to Chriſt, when he asked him ſome meat; <hi>Maſter, we have toyled all night and caught nothing, never-the-leſs at thy command we will let downe the net again,</hi> and it had good ſucceſs. Though thy former working hath been but a toyling, yet whill there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, let down the net again, and thou knowes not what the fruit of it may be.</p>
            <p>The point, in the laſt place, affoords ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conſolation to beleevers, that their ſtrength is in Chriſt; let thy diſcouragments be never ſo many, from thy duties, thy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, or what may be, here ane anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to them all. <hi>Hanibal</hi> the Carthaginian on a tyme ſent out his brother <hi>Mago</hi> to view the Roman Army, and when he returned, he told him the Roman Army were many thouſands moe then they were; Thou art miſtaken, ſayes <hi>Hanibal,</hi> how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands counts thou me for; There is a great deal of counting in the ſtrength of Chriſt, thy treaſurer, if thou canſt lift thy eyes to the Hills, from whence thy help comes. Thou art now like <hi>Sampſon</hi> poſſibly in the way to his mariage to <hi>Timnath,</hi> there came
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35410:52"/>out a young Lyon and roared againſt him, But the Spirit of the Lord came on <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and he did tear the Lyon as he would tear a kide, The Lyon had not only a doe with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but with the Spirit of the Lord, that came upon him. Thy adverſary hath to doe with the ſtrength of Chriſt, againſt whom no weapon that is formed can proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>But I goe to the ſecond branch of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: That, <hi>as our ſtrength ſo our righteouſneſs is in Chriſt.</hi> This point is much debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Papiſts. What is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in it, I ſhall paſs, and ſince it is the very heart of the Goſpel, as it were, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but regrait, that we are ſo little in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to you, and preſſing it upon you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpeak any thing of inherent righteouſneſs, which, otherwayes excellent Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> hath advanced too high, in order to a ſinners juſtification before God. And though he goe farr enough from the Papiſts, yet he goes too near the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting that faith juſtifies as it is a work, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding love in the nature of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only, in the Cloſe of this Sermon, briefly ſet down what is neceſſary for you to know, and beleive, in reference to Chriſts righteouſneſs becoming ours; and ſhall do it in theſe four particulars.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:35410:53"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew you that the beſt works of the Saints ſtand in need of imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to cover their defects that are into them. 2dly, That this righteouſneſs is clearly to be found in Chriſt. 3dly, Shall ſhew a little of the way how this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs becomes ours. And laſtly, ſhall apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the beſt works of the Saints, I ſay even their beſt works, ſtand in need of a righteouſneſs to cover their defects. There be three wayes how the godly ſtand in need of a righteouſneſs without them. 1. When they doe theſe things, which in their very <hi>nature</hi> God hath forbidden. In which caſe, all will confeſs they have need of Chriſts righteouſneſs; <hi>David</hi> for his adultery, <hi>Peter</hi> for his denyal of Chriſt. 2dly, When they doe theſe things, that for their <hi>ſubſtance</hi> are commanded, but not in a <hi>right manner;</hi> as, if they pray, but not in faith: here is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which brings them under the need of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. 3dly, Suppoſe the work they doe, be, for the <hi>matter,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and alſo right in the <hi>manner,</hi> be done in love and faith, yet there is ſtill a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the <hi>meaſure,</hi> It is no <hi>perfect</hi> faith nor perfect love; to which we are bound by the law. Now this brings us under a neceſſity of Chriſt, ſince, ſuppoſe in our beſt actions, there is not a perfection, ſuch as the law requires,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35410:53"/>there is a ſinful defect, and conſequently need of a righteouſneſs from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> That this righteouſneſs is alenarly to be found in Chriſt. 1. There is no poſſibility of it upon mans part: His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obedience is all debt to God, and his paſſive, although it ſhould mount to ane eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſuffering, could not reach a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, for the defects of his active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. 2dly, Chriſts obedience is a moſt proper ſatisfaction to juſtice, it was his own: He reſtored more glory to offended juſtice then Adam and all his ſons could take from it. Yea all the torments of the damned in Hell doe not amount to any thing worthy to be compared with the merit of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt. They pay their debt in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, but can never compleat the ſoume; and though they could perfectly ſatisfy, it would not merit. But Chriſt payed all in a lump togither, and that which he payed was of infinit value.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How this becomes ours? 1. There is a legal onneſs betwixt Chriſt and us: The debt is one, the ſolution one, and, in a forenſick and legal ſenſe, the perſons are one. So that there cannot come another reckoning upon the debitor after the ſurety hath payed; this righteouſneſs of Chriſt, being the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our cautioner, is imputed to us,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35410:54"/>or accounted ours, as if we ourſelves had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt:</hi> Behold the great priviledge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, how defective ſoever their inherent righteouſneſs be, their imputed is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Labour to ſhare in this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: And for this, ſee thy need of it, all our righteouſneſs is as ane unclean thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beleeve there is no more required to make it thyne, but to accept it, and reſt on it, on the tearms as it is offered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Doe not abuſe it: It is dreadful to turn the grace of God into wantoneſs: We ought alſo to be diligent, as if Chriſt had done nothing, and yet ſo denyed to our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſo much in thriſting after this righteouſneſs, as if we had done nothing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Improve it, there is in it a full ſufficient ground to anſwer all fears and challengs: Our only conſolation is grounded upon it. <hi>Melander</hi> in his <hi>Jolaſia</hi> hath a Story of a dying man to whom Sathan appeared vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in the room where he was lying, and ſetting himſelf down by him, told him he was came to writt up the ſinnes of his life before him; and after he had written down ſeveral and read them over, writt next (ſaid the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35410:54"/>dying man) for all theſe my cautioner hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſatisfied, and in him I am diſcharged, and therewith Sathan evaniſhed. What truth there may be in this Story, I know not; but ſure I am, the only ground of our plea before God reſults from this righteouſneſs, without it we are altogither undone, <hi>Tutius eſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbere in Chriſtum,</hi> was <hi>Bellarmins</hi> dying words, whatever he wrott.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a cloud of Martyrs:</hi> But here it is not put for ſuch as did witneſs for Chriſt only paſſivly, but alſo actively; eſpecially they did teſtify the great things that can be brought to paſs by faith; they are called <hi>a cloud,</hi> for their multitude: <hi>Denſum,</hi> ſaith Calvin on the place, <hi>opponitur raro.</hi> And they <hi>compaſs us about;</hi> There is ane aluſione to the pillar that guided Iſrael through the wilderneſs, that went before them in the day tyme, but this cloud <hi>compaſſeth us about,</hi> ſo that wherever we caſt our eyes, in what ever eſtait, they may be in our view.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:35410:55"/>
            <p>There be ſome queſtions ſtaited by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters on the words, which I paſs, not being of great weight nor futing the preſent ſcope; I intend to take only one Obſervation from the words and handle it in this Sermon.</p>
            <p>Obſervation. <hi>That it is a great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to patient running in our Chriſtian courſe, that we are compaſſed with ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, as are from Abel in the former Chapter.</hi> Or more clearly, <hi>That the examples of the famous worthies under the Old Teſtament, ought to influence our Cheerfulneſs in wreſtling with the croſs in our Chriſtian courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Obſervation is the Apoſtles ſcop here, and we have the ſame Argument uſed by other Apoſtles, to preſs the ſame concluſion, Iam. 5: 10. <hi>Take my Brethren the Prophets, for ane example, of ſuffering affliction, and of patience.</hi> The Prophets for ane example! Let Romans talk of their <hi>Camilli,</hi> their <hi>Fabricii,</hi> their <hi>Scipio's:</hi> Philoſophers, of their <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Pithagoras:</hi> We are to take our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py from the Prophets, all of which have been eminent for patient ſufferings. It is not my purpoſe to inſiſt in opening what force there may be in example, to induce us to patient ſufferings; I ſhall briefly ſay only theſe things of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That example is not that which formally
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35410:56"/>oblidges us to patience in-ſufferings: The obligation refults from the Law of God: His precepts, though there were no example at all, make patience our duty, we ought in this caſe to ſay with Joſua, <hi>Though all men should forſake the Lord, I, and my houſe will cleave to him.</hi> But they are excellent incouragements to excit and incourage to obedience to the precept.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are incouragements ſuited well to mans nature, who is more led by his eye, then his ear. <hi>What am I better then my Fathers,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elijah?</hi> Can we look for more priviledges, nor the Prophets? Minors are aſhamed when they cannot endure, what men of an higher order indures; ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as theſe, ſuit better with our nature, then any precepts whatſoever. I cannot here paſs what a lait Author, Doctor <hi>Stilling fleet,</hi> hath written in a lait Book for the Churches peace, that ſcriptural examples, except they be practiſes conſonant to the principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall equity, or to ſome poſitive Law of God, have no force to oblidge to imitation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were Prophets and Apoſtles. This doctrine hath need to be better cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, then that author does; for if it hold true, in the latitude He delivers, he ſhall not only depryve the Church of ſeveral things conſtantly practiſed in it, which have no other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35410:56"/>foundation at all but Apoſtolick practiſe, ſuch as Impoſition of hands in ordination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the keeping of the firſt day of the week for the Sabboth; But upon his principle, Apoſtolick practiſe hath no more force to oblidge then Diabolick: For if what they doe, be conſonant to the principles of moral equity, or to ſome proſitive Law, as their confeſſing of Chriſt, why may not we doe the like? The Apoſtle thinks ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. But not purpoſeing to inſiſt on the force of example, ſince the A poſtle propoſes the example, we are to imitat here, under the metaphor of a cloud of witneſſes, I ſhall, (that we may the better find out what ground of incouragement we have from it) 1. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what theſe witneſſes does depon. 2dly, How valide their teſtimony is, which the Apoſtle furniſhes ground for, in calling them a <hi>cloud,</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> a cloud, and a cloud <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing</hi> us about.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is it that theſe witneſſes does depon, that may be for our incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And here I ſhall only pitch upon theſe things. 1. They depon what will be the lot of a Chriſtian in following Chriſt. 2. What is his duty under this lot. 3. What are his fitteſt in couragements. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They depon what will be a Chriſtians lot in following Chriſt. They all depon that this will be the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35410:57"/>croſſe; ſee in the preceeding Chapter, from <hi>Abel,</hi> who is the firſt of the witneſſes, to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> who is the laſt, and you ſhall find all their experiences witneſſing to this. It is true, their croſſes were of different natures, <hi>Abel</hi> murthered, <hi>Noah</hi> toſſed with a deludge, <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſojourne in a ſtrange land, and <hi>Moſes</hi> to be hide when new borne, for fear of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Murderers: ſome met with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the fyre, ſome with the edge of the ſword, ſome tortured, yet all met with ſome kinde of croſſe or another.</p>
            <p>But ye may ſay what incoutagement is there in this part of theſe witneſſes teſtimonie? There is very much init. For 1. It takes away the opinion of the ſingularitie of the croſſe. 2dly, It taks away the reproach of the croſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It takes away the opinion of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of the croſſe: The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> propoſes as ane incouragement to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to whom he wrott, <hi>Think not ſtrang concerning the fyrie tryal, as if ſome ſtrang thing did befall you.</hi> It diſcouraged even Elijah, <hi>I alone am left, and they ſeek my life.</hi> But when <hi>Abel</hi> killed, <hi>Abraham</hi> baniſhed, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſawn aſunder, &amp;c. We are not left alone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It takes away the reproach of it. The croſs uſually carries with it, in the eſteem of the world, ane challenge of guiltineſs, you are ane Hypocryt, ſaid <hi>Jobs</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:35410:57"/>Friends to him, becauſe ſo corrected. But when we ſee the righteous <hi>Abel</hi> murthered, and faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> ſo tryed, and <hi>Moſes</hi> the Friend of God; Where is there place for this reproach? Beſide, the croſſe uſually renders men out wardly deſpicable, and under the Old Teſtament, before Chriſt ſuffered, it was certainly (as many divyns think) more reproachful nor it is now fince Chriſt ſuffered. But among other things, this takes off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of it, that ſuch a cloud of witneſſes did under goe it; <hi>Am I better then my Fathers,</hi> ſaid <hi>Elijah:</hi> we are not the firſt that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſhip to the ſea of affliction. So that this part of their teſtimony is eminently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> They depon what is mans duty under the croſſe. And this is alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable: There be theſe three things they depon to be mans duty, under it, in reference to affliction. 1. To prepare for it before it come. 2dly, To ſubmit the determination of our lot to God, and follow his rule, though we ſee the croſs before us. 3dly, To beleeve and credit his promiſes: even when under it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They depon of it as a Chriſtian's duty to prepare for it ere it come. This <hi>Noah</hi> depons, verſ. 7. <hi>Being warned of God he prepared ane Arke to ſave himſelf and his Family.</hi> Thus Rahab the Harlot, who
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35410:58"/>receaved the ſpies, who periſhed not with them that beleeved not, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. Thus <hi>David, Gideon, Jephtath,</hi> verſ. 5. and indeed this is a very neceſſary duty in referrence to afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt it find us unawarſe, and ſurpriſe us, crying <hi>Peace, peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They depon it is mans duty to ſubmit the determination of their lot to God, and follow his rule. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> went out of his own Country to a ſtang Land, on the call of God, though he knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> choſed affliction with the people of God, and deſpyſed the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and fled to <hi>Midian.</hi> Thus Iſrael paſſed through the red Sea, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. And thus many others of them, and indeed this alſo is a very ſutable duty to theſe who are afflicted, to ſubſcry be God a blank, to writt downe in it what he pleaſes, and though we ſee not what will be the event of his way to us, yet as one in a mi2ty day, if we can have as much light as to ſee where the high way, he calls us to walk in, lyeth, that ſayes we are about our duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They all depon, all this wholl cloud of witneſſes, for the uſefulneſs of faith under affliction. By faith <hi>Abraham, Noah, Sara, Iſaack, Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. did endure. It is not for nought that faith is called our victory, whereby we overcome the World, and in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35410:58"/>this their faith, there are theſe three very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: 1. The variety of conditions, as to the knind of the croſſe, was very great; Some killed, ſome baniſhed, ſome long barren, ſome tortured; yet the duty they all follow is one, that is to beleeve. 2. The inducement they had to beleeve, was one in all of them, they conſidered all who he was that made the promiſes; <hi>Noah</hi> warned of God beleeved, <hi>Abraham</hi> called of God beleeved; even <hi>Rahab,</hi> who was one of the worſt of them for perſonal faults, could tell the ſpyes, <hi>God will deliver us into your hand;</hi> to conſider the promiſes as proceeding from God, who is a Father, and ſo means honeſtly in them, and a Father Almighty, who out of the aſhes of <hi>Iſaak</hi> can accompliſh them; This makes them eaſy to be beleeved. 3. Though all their faiths was not of one pitch, yet all had comfortable out gates by it; <hi>Sarahs</hi> was not like <hi>Abrahams,</hi> theſe who went through the red Sea, their faith not like <hi>Moſes's</hi> yet all came throw as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that, if our faith come not up the hight <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> did, yet we may find the ſweet of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the croſſe; as <hi>Sarah</hi> whoſe faith we can ſcarely read of in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> yet by faith ſhe received a ſon. If you ask, what is this for our incouragement, that theſe witneſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon theſe to be our duty? Surely very much:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35410:59"/>amongſt many things, I name but theſe two: 1. Often, in times of affliction, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſted about our duty, one that can preach ſutable duties to the croſſe, and preſſe them on others in proſperity, yet will find his minde in adverſitie like a troubled foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, where the mud is mixed with the clear watter. Now to have this cloud of witneſſes, by their teſtimonie goeing before us, and haveing a road among the ſnow in a winter day, to us what ane incouragement is it?</p>
            <p>Beſide <hi>ſecondly,</hi> though the ſame dutie be preſcrybed us, which they depon, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of the word, for Chriſt bids us oft beleeve under affliction; yet to have them, after tryal of what is commanded, deponing the uſefulneſs of ſuch and ſuch a dutie, what ane incouragement is it? It is as if one ſhould take a recept of Phiſick, and come to a ſick perſon, and tell him. when my diſeaſe was as yours is, I tryed this potione and it cured me, this is very incouraging. And this leads to the 3d branch of their teſtimonie, in which they depon what are the moſt excellent cordials under affliction, eſpecially theſe five.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They conſidered what they were in themſelves, who were called out to meet the croſſe, <hi>Pilgrims, ſtrangers,</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>theſe all died in faith, confeſſing that they were pilgrims
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35410:59"/>and ſtrangers on the earth.</hi> The croſſe meets not a beleever in his own countrie, but, like a dog, barks at a ſtranger; could we come to confeſs that we are pilgrims, we would not ſtumble at a pilgrims intertainment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They did conſider how much honour did aryſe from the croſs in the way of dutie, beyond ſinful proſperity; thus <hi>Moſes</hi> eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of Aegypt, which he could not enjoy without complying with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors of Iſrael. The Lord ſometimes ſtates the caſe ſo to his people that they muſt either ſuffer or ſin, and in ſuch a caſe the croſs is their hyding place from ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They conſidered how uſeful their ſufferings would be for the Church of God, after their times: This comforted: ſee v. 34. <hi>They quenched the violence of fire, they ſtopped the mouths of lyons, eſcaped the edge of the ſword,</hi> What? How holds this true? I ſhall not diſlike the opinion ſome interpreters have on the ſence of that place, that their victory was as great by faith, as if they had quenched it, &amp;c. But I like better their gloſs, who think that their being devored of the fire, they quenched it for others; that ſhould come after them: The blood of the Saints is the ſeed of the Church. And when a beleever looks on his ſufferings, as that which may be a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35410:60"/>comfortable ſeed for others, as the blood of the primitive Martyrs was for us; It tends to make the croſs very comfortable, and them cheerful under it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They did frequently meditation the glory to come: <hi>Abraham, Iſaack, Jacob,</hi> were content to dwell in Tabernacles, they looked for a Citie that had foundations. <hi>Moſes</hi> had ane eye to the recompence of reward, the light momentany afflictions of this life being not worthie to be compared to the glorie, that is to be revealed; the comfortable views of it, as of a ſweet ſummer after ane winter, and a pleaſant harbour after a ſtorme, how refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In the mean time they had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intercourſe with God: <hi>Noah</hi> warned of God, <hi>Abraham</hi> called of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> indur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſeeing him that is inviſible; all the reſt will be like cyphers without their figure, that makes no number, if this be wanting in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>Thus we have opened the firſt thing we propoſed, what theſe witneſſes doe depon. But if the things they depon be falſe, and hold not true how comfortable ſoever they be, they are of no weight. Therefore in the ſecond place, let us conſider how ſure and valide in law their teſtimony is, and to evidence this we ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> conſider them as a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35410:60"/>cloud. 2dly, As ſuch or ſo great a cloud. 3dly, As a cloud compaſſing us about. For all the three, the Apoſtle ſets down in the text for the argument, to prove the weight and validitie of their teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider them as a cloud and this, interpreters think may be taken under a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold notion, either as it is a Meraphor, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifing ſomewhat that is not expreſſed, or as it is ane Alluſion to the Lords way in conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſrael throw the wilderneſs in the day time by a piller of a cloud. Now in both the two it is very weighty to our purpoſe. 1. As it is a Metaphor it imports a multitude, <hi>Denſum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) <hi>oponitur raro.</hi> A cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes is a multitude of witneſſes; &amp; this tends much to confirme the teſtimony, <hi>In the Mouth of two or three witneſſes shall every teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſtand firm,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: but here, not only two or three, but a great multitude, all uniting in deponing the ſame thing for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. I know not if the Obſervation of ſome will hold true, but it is remarkable, if it doe, that the number of Chriſtians was yet never ſo great in any one age of the Church, as the number of Martyrs have been in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ages, under the Heathen, Arian and Popiſh perſecutions. So, that is the firſt thing confirms the teſtimony, the witneſſes are ſo many.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:35410:61"/>
            <p>But 2dly, Conſider it as alluding to the pillar of cloud in the wilderneſſe, it imports that they are witneſſes purpoſly called to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon for our incouragement. The pillar of cloud was for Iſraels conduct in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as in this they were witneſſes <hi>Infallibly guided,</hi> ſo <hi>purpoſly called</hi> to depon in our caſe, which adds not a little to the validity of the teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are not only a numerous cloud ſo purpoſly called, but they are <hi>ſuch</hi> a cloud, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, if witneſſes be not faithful underſtanding men, their teſtimony is little worth, let them never be ſo numerous. But they are <hi>ſuch</hi> a cloud: 1. Of men emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently learned; <hi>Noah</hi> is reckoned by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers among the Philoſophers <hi>Ante-dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viani,</hi> and ſome of them writ of him that he forſaw the deludge in its ſecondary cauſes. <hi>Abraham</hi> a famous Aſtronomer, <hi>Joſephus</hi> writts many things of his learning. <hi>Moſes</hi> learned in all the wiſdom of the Aegyptians. So were they eminently wyſe and prudent; and how in eſteem with God, is evident from the teſtimony he records of them in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Noah</hi> a Phoenix in his generation, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his friend and faithful, <hi>Faithful Abraham.</hi> Gal. 4. Moſes <hi>my ſervant</hi> is dead, Joſ. 1. None with ſuch <hi>a perfect heart</hi> as <hi>my ſervant</hi> David. Now a cloud of ſuch witneſſes, ſo
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35410:61"/>learned, ſo wyſe, ſo eminently eſteemed of God, ſo little tainted with earthly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in a word, ſuch of whom the world was not worthy, how ſure muſt the teſtimony be, deponed by them!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it is a cloud and ſuch a cloud, ſo we are <hi>compaſſed about</hi> with it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. There be in this, two things imported, the fulneſs of teſtimony and the clearneſs of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their teſtimony is full: There is no caſe can be triſted with, but they teſtify the uſefulneſs of faith in reference to it. If baniſhment, <hi>Abraham</hi> tryed that; if the wrath of Princes, <hi>Moſes</hi> found faith uſeful there; If barrenneſs, <hi>Sarah</hi> found it ſucceſsful; torture or what elſe, this teſtimony reaches it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is full, ſo clear, we are <hi>compaſſed with it:</hi> They doe not depon in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous tearmes, <hi>Doloſus verſatur in generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> but ſo diſtinctly and clearly, as what ever doubts be about the meaning of ſome places of Scripture, yet who can queſtion the clearneſs of their teſtimony to the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of faith in tryals. In a word, they are a number of ſuch, ſo excellently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and deponing ſo clearly, that their teſtimony cannot chooſe but be looked on as valide and ſufficient to confirme what they depone.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:35410:62"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The practical part of this doctrine, and the moſt genuine uſe of it, is, that which the Apoſtle makes in the 2d part of the verſe, <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight,</hi> &amp;c. of which we ſhall ſpeak afterward. Only at preſent, I ſhall preſs theſe few things from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Praiſe the Lord that we are not the firſt he hath triſted with affliction. There is a beaten road before us by a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. He that did firſt put ſhip to ſea, Poets could call him, <hi>Ferreus ille.</hi> But now a man of the leaſt courage can goe down in ſhips to the depths. It is very remarkable as ſome have obſerved, that there have been few or none eminent in doeing ſervice to God in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, either under the Old or New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, but have been alſo remarkable for ſuffering. <hi>Are we better then our Fathers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doe not put a wrong conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Gods diſpenfing of the croſſe, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſome in giveing thanks for the work of redemption at ſuch ane occaſion as this, are ready to ſtop and ſay, what mean the clouds that are gathering! I would ſee the outgate ere I praiſe. But ſuppoſe the worſt thou canſt imagine to befall thee, there is nothing ſingular in it. Look to the cloud of witneſſes before thee, If this ſuffice not, look to what is in the following verſe, <hi>Looking unto Jeſus the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35410:62"/>Author and finisher of our faith, who endured the croſſe.</hi> What ſtone hath he layd in his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that hath not been hewed by affliction? And wouldſt thou be ſingular?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Incourage and comfort thy ſelfe from the example of the cloud of witneſſes. there be eſpecially theſe three things in this cloud very comfortable: 1. Thou mayſt ſee that God will ſometimes moſt ſharply chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them, whom he intirly loves. <hi>Abraham</hi> was his friend, <hi>Moſes</hi> he ſpoke with him face to face, <hi>David</hi> a man after his own heart, and yet all of them triſted with afflictione. If thou ſhall goe and conclude the contrary from the Rod, thou ſhall offend againſt the generation of his children, Pſal: 73.15. 2dly, Thou hes this encouragement from the cloud, that though the Lord hath even a controverſy, even againſt his choyſeſt ſervants, yet uſually he triſts their ſufferings, not for their ſins, but upon ſome account he is concerned in himſelf. Thus <hi>Abel</hi> dyes for his ſacrifice, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſuffers in following the rule and command of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> his reproach is the reproach of Chriſt There were quarrels enew God had with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he might have ſtated their ſufferings upon; God uſually brings ungodly men to ſufferings for their adulteries, murthers &amp;c. But the marks his people bears about in their bodies, are

            <p>IT is our great incouragement to have the example of ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, holding out the tryed uſefulneſs of faith to us under affliction. Now we are to enquire how we are to improve it. <hi>Let us,</hi> ſayeth the Apoſtle, <hi>lay aſide every weight, and runn with patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt other things, this phraſe rends to prove the Epiſtle to be Pauls, who frequently in his other Epiſtles alludes to the Olympick and pythick Games. So here, it ſuits well
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35410:64"/>to his ſtyle. In theſe Games, ſuch as were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did ſhake themſelves looſe of what would hinder them.</p>
            <q>Abſtinuit venere &amp; Baccho qui pithia cantat.</q>
            <p>There are ſome would limit this weight to ſome particular, taking the following words as a limitation of the ſin that ſo eaſily beſets us; underſtanding by it, either original ſin, which does indeed eaſily beſet us; or our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant ſin, which eaſily maſters us. But judicious <hi>Eſtius</hi> on the place takes the words more generally; and, though a Jeſuit, yet very oft a very ſound interpreter. And this ſeems to have been the mind of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this Scripture, who have rendered it, <hi>every weight,</hi> which was alſo the cuſtome of the gamiters, to whom the Apoſtle alludes. What ever weight may be a hinderance, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be original ſin, or our predominant ſin, or what elſe ſoever, we are to lay it from us, ſo long as the race laſts, and not to take it up again.</p>
            <p>But that I may come to what I deſigne from this inference, we may conſider this part of the Apoſtles precept, <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight,</hi> under a twofold relation. 1. As it relates to the words going before, and is ane inference out of them, inferred by ane illative <hi>therefore,</hi> haveing <hi>therefore</hi> ſuch a cloud, <hi>Let us lay aſide,</hi> &amp;c. 2. As they relat to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35410:64"/>the words following, the <hi>running of the race with patience,</hi> and ſo ane alluſion to the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Games. They containe ane introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act to our running. Firſt we muſt lay aſide weights, and then runn, and in both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations I ſhall ſpeak a little of them in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Conſider them as ane infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, any at firſt view may think they are not a very appoſit way of inference from what the Apoſtle hath commended ſo much in the cloud of witneſſes, that which the Apoſtle hath commended in them is their faith all along throughout the former Chapter: And it would ſeem the inference, where the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent is, <hi>Haveing ſuch a cloud ſo eminent for faith,</hi> ought to be, <hi>let us beleeve;</hi> &amp; not this, <hi>let us lay aſide,</hi> &amp;c. Some interpreters anſwer to this, that the Apoſtle, delighting to follow the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of the Olympick games, propoſed the inference thus. But this anſwer is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſatisfy. They anſwer better that ſay, the Apoſtle ſuppoſes faith to be neceſſar in laying aſide weights. For, as <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith did ſhake off the intanglements in leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his country, and <hi>Moſes</hi> by faith the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, when he chooſed the reproach of Chriſt, and <hi>Rahab</hi> when ſhe received the ſpyes. So the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le propoſeing that a Chriſtian is to lay aſide
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35410:65"/>the weights; underſtands, by <hi>faith,</hi> and it is more rethorical then if he had expreſſed it. Taking it then for a thing ſuppoſed, we ſhall briefly ſpeak a little to this</p>
            <p>Obſervation, <hi>That the only effectual mean, for laying aſide intangling weights in our Chriſtian courſe, is faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus all the cloud of witneſſes mentioned in the former Chapter found it. There be two branches of the point. 1. That faith is ane effectual mean for ſhaking off weights. 2dly. That without faith it is impoſſible to doe it, For the Apoſtle ſuppoſing it, giveth ground for both.</p>
            <p>For the 1ſt. To ſhew the influence that faith hath upon our laying aſide of weights, I ſhall deſire theſe five things may be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Faith helps to crucify the luſts and inclinations of the heart to theſe intangling weights; it is not any intrinſick excellency in theſe weights that makes them ſo ill to be layd aſide, as the ſtrength of our inclination after them: As it is not the excellency of the bait that tends ſo much to intangle the bird in the net, as its own inclination to it. Now faith takes away the fewel that feeds this fire. It crucifies theſe inclinations, and purifies the heart from them, Acts 15. God is ſaid to <hi>purify the heart by faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith doth not only crucify our
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35410:65"/>inclination to theſe weights, but it discovers, them to a Chriſtian in their native colours: Uſually theſe things that prove weights in our Chriſtian courſe are ſo painted, that they appear far more beautiful then they are, and ſo worſe to be layd aſide. But faith unmasks them, ſo that a beleever can ſpeak of them in a farr other ſtrain then another can doe. See how <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice,</hi> fitting in the <hi>judgement-ſeat</hi> on him, Acts 25: 23. <hi>And when Agrippa and Bernice were come with great pomp,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with a great many phanſies,</hi> ſo looks Paul on all their pomp. And on his external priviledges, Phil. 3. <hi>as dung.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be caſten to dogs. And what ever account Egyptians made of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> treaſures, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw them to be but <hi>the pleaſures of ſin that indured for a ſeaſon.</hi> Now when weights are thus diſcerned, and thus they are by faith, how eaſie is it to lay them aſide?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith poſſeſſes the ſoul with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods care and proviſion of theſe things that often prove weights to us. It is a remarkable word, Heb. 13: v. 5. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſuch things as you have for he hath ſaid, I will not leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> There is enough for faith to be content upon, if it have, <hi>He hath ſaid,</hi> Not that it deſtroyes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35410:66"/>neceſſary means, <hi>Add to your faith vertue,</hi> 2 Pet. 1:7. But when any thing becomes a weight to imped our running in our race, the ſoul that beleeves can lay it aſide, and truſt God for what may be convenient in that kind. Again, <hi>The life that I live in the flesh is by ſaith in the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2: <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>He loved me and gave himſelf for me,</hi> and for temporal things, <hi>I will live by faith in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Faith puts the ſoul upon higher deſignes then theſe weights can amount to, and ſo makes them eaſier to be undervalued, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39:6. See how <hi>David</hi> deſpyleth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements of wordlings? <hi>Surely man walketh in a vain shew, they diſquyet themſelves in vain, heaping up riches.</hi> What is this <hi>a vain shew?</hi> How cames the Pſalmiſt to inſert this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe? See him in the next verſe, ſee him on a higher deſigne, <hi>And now Lord what wait I for, my hope is in thee, deliver me from all my tranſgreſſions.</hi> I am, ſaid the great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> a King, and not a merchant, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ſen him ane offer of many talents to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Greece</hi> again; He told <hi>Parmenio,</hi> it might ſute with him to take <hi>Darius</hi> offer, but not with <hi>Alexander.</hi> When a beleever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiders what ane inheritance, what a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, how excellent ane husband, what ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Communion, what wonder theſe weights be eaſily laid aſide! and this is done by faith.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:35410:66"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> By ſaith the ſprength of Chriſt is brought in, to help to lay aſide theſe weights: And thus it becomes eaſie. <hi>I know how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi> Philipp. 4. <hi>and how to want, I can doe all things through him, that ſtrengthens me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As all theſe wayes ſhew how uſeful, faith is for laying aſide theſe weights, ſo in then next place, I ſhall ſhew that without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to lay them aſide. For</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The inclination of our heart is ſo ſtrong to theſe things, that often prove weights, that without faith it is impoſſible to ſubdue it: and conſequently, to lay them aſide. All the light and ſtrengt of natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duements could never bring Heathens to mortification of theſe weights. Even <hi>Seneca,</hi> who gave the moſt excellent precepts of any Heathen, yet was eminently tained with earthly-mindedneſs. Yea even ſuch as have ſome meaſure, yea a great meaſure, of faith, have work enough with it. It is conceived by many learned, that Satan tempted Chriſt with all the Kingdoms of the earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. becauſe he knew it was ane allutment by which he prevailed with the moſt eminently Godly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Without faith a man cannot put and thing better in the place of theſe weights, and therefore cna hardly lay them aſide. Ane
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35410:67"/>unbeleever, of his riches muſt ſay, as <hi>Micha</hi> of his Idols, <hi>Ye have taken away me Gods, and what have I more,</hi> But a beleever, if he lay aſide theſe, he can ſay as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did when he had devyded all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom among his followers, and one asked him, what he reſerved for himſelfe, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Hope.</hi> They have hope as ane anchor both ſure and faſt: Yea not only hope, but alſo ſomething to rejoice in for the preſent, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3: <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Although the figg tree should not bloſſome, and the wyne shold not yeeld her fruit, and the labour of the olive should fail, yet I will rejoice in God, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Corrupt reaſon in man is no ſmall friend to the retaining of theſe weights, prone to ſuggeſt, even in a Peter, <hi>Maſter pity thy ſelfe.</hi> The remarkable Hiſtory of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> written by <hi>Sleidan</hi> and others, is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this purpoſe, who, being allured by his relationes and poſſeſſiones, did renounce the faith he had formerly owned, and how tragical his end was all know. Now when reaſon appears ſuch a friend to the retaining of theſe weights, if there be not faith to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballance, who can lay them aſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See the way then, and the only way, how to get theſe weights layd aſide, even the ſame
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:35410:67"/>that influenced <hi>Noahs</hi> building of the Ark, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> forſaking of his country. Many purpoſe and reſolve againſt theſe weights, but, as without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, ſo, to lay theſe weights aſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Look well to thy faith, which in this caſe I may ſay, as the Apoſtle ſayes in ane other caſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. thou art above all things to take to thee. And in order to this I ſhall only preſs theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed thy faith be not counterfite: For 1ſt. There is nothing keeps one further off from the truth of faith, then the counterfite of it: As the counterfite Religion <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up as ane engyn to keep the ten trybs from the true Religion which was at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> So Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than ſets up in many a counterfite faith, which keeps them from ſeeking after the truth of it. Beſide, if thy faith be counterfite, all is but counterfite, thy prayer, thy hope, thy praiſes; Thy laying aſide of weights will be but a ſeeming act, it is with our faith, as with a mariage, if a woman be not maried all her children are baſtards; therefore look well to it, that thy faith be not counterfite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be training and excerciſing thy faith. We uſe to walk upon the credit of the promiſes, as one beginning to walk upon the ice, when firſt they ſet their foot on, ay fearing it crack under us and we fall in: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:35410:68"/>as, if there were a training of ourſelves to excerciſe faith on the promiſes, on things of dayly occurrence, as to be acting it for our meat, for our reſt at night, and ſee what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count God gives of us in the moring, for our health, for our inward peace, we ſhould come the more eaſily, on the credit and faith of the promiſe, to lay aſide weights that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped us in our race.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Put forth acts of faith on Chriſt, not only for juſtification, but for ſanctiſying graces. Uſually all that are not Papiſts know that they muſt be juſtified by faith alone; but for ſanctification, a part whereof is the laying aſide of weights, we labour to wring it out of our own hearts, as if Chriſt were not the author and finiſher of it, and as if we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve with <hi>Arminians</hi> that Chriſt had not died to putchaſe faith to us, but it were in the power of a mans will to beleeve or not beleeve, accordingly as he uſed his natural induements: but this being done, the laying aſide of weights becomes farr more eaſie, yea and pleaſant, to us.</p>
            <p>But I come now to conſider this precept of laying aſide weights, as it relates to the words following, <hi>Let us runn with patience,</hi> in which conſideration, by ane alluſion to the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick and Pithick games, they contain ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory act to the running of the race.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:35410:68"/>1ſt The weights muſt be layd aſide, and then run, and thus they affoord this</p>
            <p>Obſervation, <hi>That the example of a cloud of witneſſes will not be ſufficiens to influence our running our race with patience, if there be not mortifieation to both outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impediments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both are comprehended under weights here, and both muſt be mortified, it being uſual in Scripture to expreſs mortification by this phraſe of <hi>laying aſide,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1:21. I ſhall briefly only prove the point and apply it. For proofe of it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5: 10. <hi>Take, my Brethren, the Prophets for ane exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſpoke to you in the name of the Lord, of patient ſufferings;</hi> But will this ſuffice? No, the Apoſtle thinks fitt to add, <hi>be patient Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſtablish your hearts, grudge not.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that if there be no more but exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though even of the Prophets, who ſpoke in the name of the Lord, it will not doe the turne, if there be not ſome work upon the ſpirit of a man himſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is indeed ane undenyable truth, examples are of excellent uſe in our Chriſtian courſe, <hi>ſunt nonnulli,</hi> ſaid holy Bernard, <hi>quos ad amorem patriae, plus exempla quam praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta ſuccendunt.</hi> But there are two things in the words, to paſs many other, that I ſhall only make uſe of, to evince this, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35410:69"/>beſide the example, there muſt be a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and laying aſide theſe impediments. 1. They are <hi>weights.</hi> 2. They are <hi>ſins</hi> that <hi>eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> eaſily <hi>beſett us.</hi> And in both, the Apoſtle intends arguments to lay them aſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider them as <hi>weights;</hi> ſo they are very unſuitable to a race; if they be not mortified, they produce two things, very unſuitable for a race, they weaken us, and they intangle us.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, They <hi>weaken</hi> us. Our ſtrength, how little ſoever it be, muſt be devyded betwixt our journey &amp; our burdens: It is not all to be ſpent upon our race. <hi>Pcrerius</hi> thinks when <hi>Abraham</hi> was about to offer <hi>Iſaack</hi> he did not tell <hi>Sarah,</hi> for as ſtrong as his faith was, there was work eneough for it, though <hi>Sarah</hi> were not ingadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him. Whereas he that layes aſide theſe weights, is not ſo overlayd, nor hath he his ſtrength devided. It was a remarkable anſwer, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> reports in <hi>Apophthegms, Diogenes</hi> on a time gave to <hi>Plato, Plato</hi> had become ſomewhat leſs in reputatione, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had gone to <hi>Sicily</hi> to the Tyrant <hi>Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſius,</hi> and received great gifts from him, and on a day coming into <hi>Diogenes</hi> Cell, he found hm dyning on roots; whereupon <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid to him, if thou could'ſt pleaſe <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> thou needed not eat roots: <hi>Diogenes</hi> replyed,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:35410:69"/>If thou couldſt eat roots thou needed not pleaſe <hi>Dyoniſius. Diogenes</hi> thought <hi>Plato</hi> weakned by this, he could not eat roots. He that is mortified to wordly pleaſures, hath his ſtrength intire for his race.</p>
            <p>Beſide 2dly, As they are weakning, ſo they are exceedingly <hi>intangling, no man that warreth,</hi> ſayeth the Apoſtle 2 Tim. 2:4. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelfe with the affairs of this life;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, It is a word borrowed from a bird that is intangled in a net, theſe weights are as a net round about us, that by flightering we cannot winn out of. So that it may be ſaid of ſuch a perſon, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid of I ſreal, <hi>They are intangled, they are intangled;</hi> and how unſuitable is this for a race?</p>
            <p>But let us take the Apoſtles other expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they doe <hi>eaſily beſet us,</hi> and in this two things <hi>I</hi> would open. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Shew you that ſin does eaſily beſet. 2dly, What force is in this to preſs the laying it aſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it eaſily beſets, is evident from theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How eaſily does the tentations to it take in thee, as ſparks lighting among tinder? <hi>Immediatly,</hi> or <hi>ſtraightway, He went after her,</hi> ſayes <hi>Salomon,</hi> of the young man and ſtrange woman. God muſt draw us, we pull as it were againſt him. But any tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kindles us as it were in ane inſtant.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:35410:70"/>
            <p>Beſide 2dly, ſinful ſuggeſtions, they ſeat ſo inſenſibly into the minde, that even when we are in moſt ſpiritual duties, ere we are awar we find ourſelves overcharged by them. As <hi>Junius</hi> complained, that often when he was in prayer, his mind was in the gallery he had ſeen in <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea even after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and purpoſed againſt them, yet, like <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> we are ready to commit uncleaneſs in the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it is no wonder, there is no ſin but it hath a party within us! We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, as once our Captain did, when we are to encounter tentations, <hi>The Prince of this World cometh againſt me, but he hath nothing within me.</hi> It hath much within us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder it eaſily beſet us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Now there is a great deal of ſtrength in his argument, to preſs us to lay it aſide.</p>
            <p>For 1. That it <hi>beſets</hi> us, hath the force of ane argument into it. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the old latin renders it, <hi>circumſtans,</hi> Beza, <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingens.</hi> It is as a belt round about us, or as a wall ſtanding about us. If we look before us, or behind us, or what ever way we will, we will find tentations from it; in what ever part of our race, we will find a weight from it. Therefore mortify it; otherwayes, if called to active obedience, or paſſive, it will hing on, for it beſets us.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:35410:70"/>
            <p n="2">2dly, As it beſets us, ſo it <hi>eaſily</hi> beſets us; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this hath the force of another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in it. If we mortify not, though our argument from examples were never ſo great, we may conclude, tentationes &amp; corruptiones will ſurely hinder us in our race, for, they beſet us, and eaſily beſet us; we have good reaſon of taking heed in caſting ſparks among flax, ſince it ſo eaſily kindles: And no leſs in laying aſide and mortifying corruptione, ſince in our race it ſo eaſily beſets us, being as a wall built round about us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> it reproves thoſe who, in order to their encountering tryals, labour for no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of weights and ſins that eaſily beſet them. For 1. The want of this makes a man altogither unmeit for difficulties in his race, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2:21. <hi>If a man therefore purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from theſe. he shall be a veſſel of honour meet for the maſters uſe.</hi> He that is not purged, is like Green wood in the fyre, when difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in his race occur, It fryes and ſmoakes, but burns not. 2dly, From the not laying aſide theſe weights it flowes, that the allurments to decline the croſſe are ſo taking: the Apoſtle <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. preceeding Chapter, ſpeaks of ſome who being <hi>tortured, would not accept deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, that they might obtain a better reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> They accepted not of deliverance,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35410:71"/>they did not like the World ſo well, as to be willing when they were ſo near heaven to be content to come back to it again, they had layd aſide theſe weights. It is a remarkable Hiſtory: <hi>Beza</hi> writs of the noble Marques of <hi>Vico, Galeacius Caractiolus,</hi> who being converted at a Sermon by <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to leave <hi>Italy</hi> and all his poſſeſſions, and come to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and live with <hi>Calvin;</hi> and when his Wyfe did hing about his armes, and ſome of his Children about his leggs, ſome lay down in his way, and all weept on him, to perſwade his ſtay with them; yet he ſhook them all off, calling to mind that of Chriſts, <hi>He that hateth not father and mother for me, is not worthy of me.</hi> 2dly, He that hath not layd aſide theſe weights is intangled, and hath not the free uſe of his life, as a <hi>Byas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boul,</hi> he muſt incline to the ſide the weight lyes on. <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi> it was ſaid of him, <hi>Iſte ſolus ſcit vivere;</hi> he had retired himſelf from <hi>Rome</hi> to his Country-houſe, that he might be free from the noyſe of the city. None know how to live, but ſuch as lay aſide theſe weights.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The point ſerves to ſtirr up all to this work of mortification to theſe weights; who would run their race with patience, reſt not on light, to make the croſs appear ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; Some may diſcourſe well in Sermons of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:35410:71"/>the neceſſity of affliction, of the uſefulneſs of it, the encouragements under it, from the example of Chriſt, and the cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: but when it comes to the tryal, ſuch are found to be, like a man that hath a good eye but a lame leg, whereby he is unfitt for his journey. That we may be the better fitted to lay them aſide, I ſhall briefly offer theſe few directions, and ſo come to a cloſe of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the Lord only calls thee to lay them aſide, when they prove weights. How excellent loever the merchant's goods be, yet when they overloade the ſhip, and the retaining of them threatning his life, he will caſt them over-boord. The neceſſary uſe of the creature-comforts he allows, but when the retaining of them lyes in the way of thy ſalvation, how reaſonable is it then to lay them aſide! As the <hi>Martyr</hi> anſwered, when one asked him if he had no regard to his Wyfe and Children, yes, yes, ſaid he, I eſteem any of them more then the Duke of <hi>Brunſwik's</hi> eſtate, but for Chriſt I can quite them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we add to this, to how much Chriſt was denied, &amp; how much, (for a while) he layd aſide for us, <hi>He thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet made himſelf of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> Phillip 2:7, 8, 9. Conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners that ye faint not.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:35410:72"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be dayly accuſtomating thyſelfe to as work of mortification to theſe weights. It was nothing ſtrange to hear <hi>Paul</hi> lay at one time: I <hi>am ready, not only to be bound, but to dye at Jeruſalem, for the name of Chriſt;</hi> when at another time he could ſay, I <hi>proteſt by my rejoicing in God, I die dayly.</hi> He that is dying dayly, cannot chooſe but be ready to die when called to it. Chriſtians ought to be doeing as porters who carry loads, ere they belayd on, taking a lift of them, and ſeeing how they weigh, forecaſting how it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them to leave ſuch enjoyments: as Mr <hi>Bilney</hi> tryed his finger in the candle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to the fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Often ponder how aboundantly God is able to recompence any thing he calls the to lay aſide upon his account, <hi>Moſes</hi> did run from the court and treaſures of Aegypt, He had ane eye to the recompence of reward; how much toyling will the ſweetneſs of gain make a man indure? Here is a recompence of reward.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THeſe words are a part of that excellent Sermon Chriſt preached on the mount, The ſcope of the whole Sermon overturnes the error of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who teach that beleevers are freed from all obligation to the obedience of the moral Law: in the 17. verſe, He taxes the folly of their thoughts who thought He was come to deſtroy the law, and by three ſtrong Arguments preſſes that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, is ſtill and will be ſtill required of men. The 1. Taken from the immutability of the Law of it ſelf, <hi>Heaven and earth shall paſs away, but one title of it shall in no wayes paſs till it be fulfilled.</hi> Another taken from the great advantage ſhall redound to men by keeping the law, in the preceeding verſe, <hi>They shall be called great in the Kingdom of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35410:73"/>Heaven.</hi> And a 3d in the words read, taken from the danger of not being more exact in obedience to it then the Phariſees and Scribs were, <hi>They shall in no caſe enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words we have a doctrinal truth, and the confirmation of it: the doctrinal truth, That except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Phariſees ye cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Kingdom of Heaven. The confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, I <hi>ſay unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the doctrinal truth, there are two things to be cleared, what is meant by the Scribs and Phariſees, and what by their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 1. A Scribe is a name of Office, whereof ſome were civil, as <hi>Shimshai,</hi> Ezra 4: 9. Some Eccleſiaſtick, who were interpreters of the Law, ſuch was <hi>Ezra</hi> himſelfe, and ſuch are meant here; they were alſo Prieſts, therefore <hi>Ezra</hi> is called both a Scribe and a Prſeſt, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.9. A Phariſee betokeneth as Sect, not ane Office; They had their name from ſeparation, not from interpretation, as ſome would have. There was three ſorts of Sects among the Jews. The <hi>Eſſen's,</hi> who were like our Popiſh Monks, living, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion retired from the World, of whom <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> relates many things. The <hi>Sadducee's</hi> dwere another ſort, they expounded the law according to the letters and ſyllabs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35410:73"/>the reſurrection of the body. And theſe <hi>Phariſies</hi> were in higheſt eſteem among them, they interpreted the law according to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they had received from the Fathers. Many things are written by many, eſpecially by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of theſe, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall not need here to repeat.</p>
            <p>For the righteouſneſs which is twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the verſe; for clearing this take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that there is a two-fold righteouſneſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture; one, <hi>imputed</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is wrought by Chriſt <hi>for</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever; ane other, <hi>imparted,</hi> which is wrought by Chriſt <hi>in</hi> the beleever. The 1ſt is the righteouſneſs of our juſtification. The 2d, Of our ſanctification. Some would have the meaning of <hi>your righteouſneſs</hi> in the words, to be underſtood of Chriſts imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. It is true our righteouſneſs, in this ſenſe, exceeds not only the righteouſneſs of the Phariſees, but of <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: But to underſtand it ſo here, ſuits not to the ſcope of the place, which is to preſs more exact holineſs and obedience to the moral law, then the Phariſees had. Therefore we underſtand it of a righteouſneſs of ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with beſt interpreters on the place.</p>
            <p>But here there ſeems to be ſome ſeeming foundation for a very dangerous errour, which ſome of lait, who profeſs to abhor the way
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:35410:74"/>of Papiſts have appeared very violent for, if there be, ſay they, in man ane inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs or holineſs, that the Scripture calls righteouſneſs, why doth it not in ſome ſenſe juſtify? <hi>Poſita,</hi> ſay Philoſophers, <hi>cauſa for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali, ponitur etiam effectus formalis.</hi> But the truth is, the way they take in this, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture, which ſpeaks of our righteouſneſs as ane unclean thing, it is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to Chriſt eſtabliſhing a righteouſneſs beſides, whereby a ſinner is juſt befor God, it ſo exalts proud man; and (in a word) the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt it and the way Socinians take, (who talk of the imputation of faith <hi>in ſenſu formali,</hi> for a mans juſtification before God,) is ſo ſmall that it is juſtly abominat by all ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; &amp; as for the name <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> on which they build ſo much, why may not they alſo on this ground plead for the juſtification of the Phariſies before God? For their way hath alſo the name of righteouſneſs. But leaving this debate; the meaning of the words briefly is, that except their holineſs was more exact then the Phariſies, who pretended to very much, they could not enter into Heaven.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only take one Obſervation, which is the very words of the Text.</p>
            <p>Obſervation, <hi>That except our righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribs and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35410:74"/>Phariſees, we can in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This truth being the very words of the text, and ſo a doctrine which even ane <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> who admits not of conſequences, would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of; We need not ſeek after other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to confirme it.</p>
            <p>Only for confirmation of it we ſhall a little conſider the proofe brought in the verſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> there be three proofs divyns uſually bring to confirme any truth: 1. Scripture. 2. Reaſon. And 3. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. We have all the three concurring in this point, I <hi>ſay unto you,</hi> all that Scripture reſolves in what God hath ſaid either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf immediatly, or by the penmen whom he hath inſpired: And there is no reaſon to prove a theologick concluſion like that, however Schoolmen have laboured to turne up the body of divinity into <hi>ariſtotles</hi> principles, lying axioms and maximes of natural reaſon to demonſtrat Theologick concluſions by, yet this is the <hi>primum credibile</hi> in divinity, <hi>Deus hoe dixit;</hi> and a concluſion ſtands only then firm in divinity, when ultimatly it reſolves in this, <hi>God hath ſaeid this.</hi> Yea, theſe things that are eſteemed parts of divine truth, and have no other foundations but from Pops Decretals or Canons of ſome Councils, are concluſions that can never be reſolved into
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35410:75"/>the principles of divinity. Yea 3dly, There is no authority like unto this, if it were never ſo ancient, yea if all antiquity unanimonuſly conſpired in one, it is but as the duſt in the ballance, that cannot weigh downe this, I <hi>ſay unto you.</hi> He is our King, he is our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and his dominion is ſo abſolut, that though there were no other reaſon, yea though there were never ſo many appearances of reaſon, againſt what he hath ſaid, as in the doctrine of the Trinity, or reſurrection of the body, yet we are to ſilence reaſon, and reſt upon his naked authority. So that in this, <hi>Iſay unto you,</hi> the point is fully confirmed, both by reaſon, Scripture, and authority.</p>
            <p>Yet ere I apply it, for clearing of the point, it ſhall be neceſſary to enquire a little wherein the righteouſneſs of the Scribs and Phariſees failed, that thereby we may the better know wherein we are to exceed them, and what righteouſneſs is required, ere we can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. There be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially two things in general, wherein the righteouſneſs of the Phariſies failed, and a righteouſneſs failing in theſe two, makes it impoſſible for one that hath no more to enter into the Kingdome of God. 1. There was ſomething they omitted and did not, that was neceſſary to qualify thoſe who enter into the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35410:75"/>Kingdom of God. 2dly, the thing they did was defective in the qualifications neceſſary to qualify the righteouſneſs of thoſe who enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There was ſomething they omitted and did not, that was neceſſary: Though they were exact obſervers of the external letter of the law, yet they did not regard the ſpiritual ſenſe of it at all, and conſequently neglected all the parts of inward obedience to God, ſuch as the mortification of inward luſts, or performing acts of inward holineſs. Now a righteouſneſs failing in this, cannot qualify a man for entering into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For 1ſt, That righteouſneſs that does not exceed the righteouſneſs of Heathens, cannot be ſufficient to qualify for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, <hi>Doe not even the Heathens the ſame,</hi> is ſufficient to caſt our moſt ſpecious performances. And how unblamably Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens have walked, as to the external duty the moral law, any acquainted with the of Hiſtories of ſome of their lives may eaſily diſcerne. Beſide 2dly, There are none in the viſible Church farther from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then Hypocrits; what a multitude of woes find we in one chapter denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them! And if they were not outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blameleſs, they ſhould not be Hypocrits. 3dly. To neglect the Spiritual ſenſe of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:35410:76"/>Law, is to be partial in the Law, and to ommit that wherein the ſoul and life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conſiſts. Heaven is a place wherein no unclean thing can enter, but he that is only outwardly blameleſs, is a rotten ſepulcher, that is full of dead mens bones within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As they ommitted the ſpiritual ſenſe of the law, ſo their righteouſneſs was defective in the qualifications abſolutly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to qualify our righteouſneſs, if we would enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Among many qualifications, in which their righteouſneſs was defective, I ſhall inſiſt only upon theſe two. 1. It proceeded not from a right principle, a principle of regeneration; to this the Phariſies were altogither ſtrangers, they not only wanted it, but did not ſo much as beleeve the neceſſity of it. Now a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs not proceeding from a principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, as it is not acceptable to God, ſo he that hath but this cannot expect to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. For</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt hath, and that very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, declared no leſs himſelfe, John 3: 3. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom.</hi> It was ſpoken to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> a Jew and Phariſie, not to a Heathen: He ſayes not, except a man leave his ſcandalous out-breakings, but <hi>except he be born again.</hi> and he confirms it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35410:76"/>with a <hi>verily, verily,</hi> which hath the force of a very ſtrong aſſeveration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Where regeneration is wanting, there is no union with Chriſt. Which of the two are firſt in order of nature and time, we need not enquire, ſeeing it is confeſſed by all they goe inſeparably togither. Now the want of union with Chriſt makes all our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performances to be rejected. It is not fruit to God, if he be not firſt maried to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 4, 5. as Children born by a woman who hath not a husband. Where there is not union with Chriſt, there is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the influences of the Spirit to aſſiſt in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a propitiatory Sacrifice to cover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of them, a Mediator of interceſſion to preſent and ſecond them, what wonder then they be rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When regeneration is wanting, the perſon is in ane eſtate of enemity againſt God, the eſtate of nature being ſuch, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. All that paſſes betwixt God and ſuch ane one, are but ſuch tranſactions as paſſe betwixt two enemies. What wonder then if the ſervice be rejected, and the perſon farr from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Lord judges not of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, as one man doth of ane others, only by the outward countenances, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> did of <hi>Jeſſe's</hi> Sons, but he judges the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:35410:77"/>outward performance by the inward frame. He can tell Iſrael when they draw near him with their lips, that their hearts are far from him; now the heart of ane unregenerat, how naughty is it? Like the Temple in Chriſts time, a den of theeves. Lay all togither, and it will be diſcerned that a righteouſneſs not proceeding from regeneration is not ſuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for our entering into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, As theſe Phariſees their righteouſneſs proceeded not from a right principle of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſo it was not directed to a right end, the glory of God, but what they did, they did it to be ſeen of men. Now a righteouſneſs not directed to a right end, is farr from being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to qualify one for the Kingdom of Heaven. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. If even our natural actions ought to be referred to the glory of God, farr more our religious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 31. <hi>Whither ye eat or drink doe all to the glory of God.</hi> If they want this, they want that moral rectitude that ought to be in them, and conſequently cannot be accepted. But here it may be asked, if ane actual reſpect to and intention of the glory of God be neceſſary for all our actions, ere they can be accepted. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Divyns diſtinguiſh a threefold reſpect to the glory of God: <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual, virtual,</hi> and <hi>actual. Habitual</hi> is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:35410:77"/>whereſoever is the habit of grace, ſuch as love, faith, &amp;c. But this is not ſufficient in regard the habit may be idle, and conſiſt with very groſs ſins, as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter. Actual</hi> is, when there is ane actual intending of the glory of God. This can hardly be attained here, it will be our happineſs in Heaven, but here it can hardly be looked upon as our duty, in regard there would be no roome for other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If ane artificer were ſtill thinking on the end of his work, or a traveller on the end of his way, it might exceedingly marr him in other things very neceſſary for that end. <hi>Virtual</hi> is when ane action is done in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and force of ſome precedent explicit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Gods glory as a ſupream end: As every ſtep of a mans journey is virtually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the end of it. Now this is ſimply neceſſary, and when any actions want this they are not acceptable. Becauſe</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The ſame action; which for the matter of it is commanded by God, yet through the want of this, is reputed ſimply ſinful by God. Take one inſtance for all to prove this. <hi>Jehu</hi> his cutting off the Houſe of <hi>Achab, Hoſea</hi> 14. <hi>I will aveng the blood of Jeſreel upon the houſe of Jehu.</hi> What will the Lord aveng it? Did he not according to the word of the Lord which he ſpake by the mouth of his Servant <hi>Elijah?</hi> Yes ſurely, the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:35410:78"/>matter was ſuch; But he did it to eſtabliſh the Kingdom in his own hand, without any reference to the glory of God, and therefore the Lord looks upon it as murther, and will be avenged on his houſe for it. Beſide, where a right end is not propoſed to the honour of God, the whole work we doe is accompted empty and hollow, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10: 1. <hi>Ephraim is ane empty vyn when He bringeth forth fruit to himſelfe.</hi> What, bringeth forth fruit, and yet empty? Yes, when it is to himſelf, and not to God.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee wherein the righteouſneſs of the Scribs and Phariſies was defective, and why thoſe who have no more, cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a twofold uſe of this we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecut: One of humilation, another of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe firſt:</hi> Is it ſo? It ſerves for terror and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation to thoſe whoſe righteouſneſs comes ſhort of the righteouſneſs of the Scribs and Phariſies. How many are there in the viſible Church expecting the Kingdom of Heaven, who come not up the length the Scribs and Phariſies did. Which that I may the more clearly evince, I ſhall offer theſe things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Phariſies were not outwardly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35410:78"/>ſcandalous: They did make clean the outſide of the cup or platter: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was a Phariſie, ſayes of himſelf <hi>Philipp.</hi> 3. that he was, in regard of the law, blameleſs. They were, upon this accompt, compared by Chriſt to painted ſepulchers: Though ſepulchers yet painted. But how many among us declares their ſin as <hi>Sodom:</hi> What a continued tract of avowed drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſwearing, uncleanneſs and ſuch like, which are not hide in corners? How doe many accompt ſobriety needleſs preceiſneſs? And think ſtrange of others who will not ſin on with them into the ſame exceſs of ryot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Phariſies were very exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the Sabboth; it is true, they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quarrelled Chriſt for doeing works of neceſſity and charity, which were ſuitable to the Sabboth. Yet in the general it may be ſeen in their cariage through many places of the Goſpel, how exact they were herein. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, though we profeſs we allow not of books of ſports for the Saboth-day, yet how few accompts it their delight, not ſpeaking their own words nor thinking their own thoughts, yea when publick worſhip is ended, as if the Saboth ended with it, ſo doe we walk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Phariſies were very exact Obſervers both of ordinary and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35410:79"/>worſhip. He that came up to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. could ſay, he faſted twice a week, they had long prayers. However the grounds of faſting were never greater, yet how little are we in humiliation this way; every family ſhall pray a part is a promiſe. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11: 12. and what a multitude is there who weary not of ſwearing and drinking whole nights and dayes, that accompt ſome few ſentences of prayer nauſeating and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious? They are as one out of their Element in ſpiritual things, and therefore like <hi>Pilat</hi> a ſtart of it and away will ſerve them. <hi>Pilat</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>What is truth,</hi> and <hi>immediatly</hi> he went forth to the Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Phariſees abhorred to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the openly flagitious, they would keep no company with the Publicans. It is true, they alſo fooliſhly quarrelled with Chriſt for it, who was among them as a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian among his patients. But it is evident themſelves abhorred it, as being in danger to be infected by them the Society of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. It is true, we muſt goe out of the World if we would altogither decline it, yet how much unneceſſary fellowſhip with them is there among us? And certainly there is not one thing by which the Godly becomes more contaminat, and affoords them more grounds of challenges, <hi>Woe is me,</hi> ſaid Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35410:79"/>
               <hi>that I dwelt in Meſchech, and ſojourned in the tents of Kedar.</hi> It is as poſſible to walk on ſyre and not be burned, as converſe with them and not be defiled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Phariſies were much in almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds and acts of charity. It is true, Chriſt tells them they did it to be ſeen of men; yet they did it. And how exceedingly defective are we herein, though it be ſo much preſſed in Scripture? And what is done herein is lent to the Lord. Yet theſe who have enough to deboach with, know not what it is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative to the neceſſities of the poor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent members of Chriſt. All theſe and many moe might be inſtanced, to evidence how far ſhort we come of the righteouſneſs of the Scribs and Phariſies, and what matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation there is in it will appear. amongſt many things might be brought, from that that is in the Text, they ſhall in no caſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. In which I ſhall only offer theſe three things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How great the loſs will prove in being debarred the Kingdome of Heaven. Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O City of God! What ane exeellent report is there made of it in Scripture? How glorious are the ſtreets of it? How ſure the foundations? How excellent the light? How noble the Temple?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:35410:80"/>And to be deprived of all this, how humbling is it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider for what thou art not like to enter into it. Prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birthright for a meſs of pottage, are the gliſtering ſhowes of vanity, that abound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, a ſufficient compenſation of ſuch a loſs? Does not this roſe grow out of a briar? And when it is grown, how ſoon doth it fade, and wither away? Art thou not like the dog in the fable, that did let the fleſh goe that he might catch the ſhaddow?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider that ſuch as enter not here, muſt enter into the lake that burns with fyre and brimſtone for ever and ever? Thou muſt either be within this Kingdom, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, where are doggs and ſwine? There is no mid place, let Papiſts talk of their Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or their limboes what they will, thou muſt either be in Heaven or Hell. Now what matter of humiliation is this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe ſecond,</hi> Of exhortation. Is it ſo, that our righteousneſs muſt exceed the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs of the Scribs and Phariſies? Then Chriſtian, labour by all means to have thy righteousneſs exceeding theirs. In order to this I ſhall ſpeak to theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take heed of the defects that abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their righteouſneſs, otherwayes we can never exceed them. And that this may be the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:35410:80"/>better done, take notice of theſe few defects in their righteousneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All their zeal did run out on the leſſer things of the Law, the paying tith of mint and cumin, and ſuch like, which Chriſt told them were not to be omitted: But the greater, they did not ſo much as with their little finger once touch. There is a natural pronneſs in our hearts to this. Theſe things may be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their own kinde, to attend ordinances, to be charitable, not to be ſcandalous: But if the greater, as mourning for ſin, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it, beleeving in Jeſus for pardon of it, be forgotten, all the reſt are but as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers without their figur, that make no num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; how many poſſibly amongſt you in this place count your evidences only on ſuch things as the Phariſies counted upon? And are very hopeful of Heaven, though ye want the farr greater things which they alſo want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Take heed of this defect.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, They were much more zealous of human inventions, then they were of Gods Commandments. We find them often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with Chriſts Diſciples about ſome external purifications and eating with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen hands, and ſuch like things: And Chriſt tells them plainly that they taught for doctrins the precepts of men. Now, if thou would exceed them in thy righteousneſs,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:35410:81"/>take heed of this defect. It is ſtrange to ſee what benſil of affection ſome have for things of mans deviſing, as of a holy day, a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in worſhip, or ſuch like, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to no other Father, but ſome eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick Cannon: Whereas their affections, like a knyff blunted in cutting ſticks, are litle or none in duties that are commanded by God himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The Phariſies, for as ſpecious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors as they were, yet they were mere Hypocrits. Chriſt thunders woes againſt them, becauſe of their Hypocryſie. He deſcrybs them by no other name, but the name of Hypocrits. There is non's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more dangerous and incorrigible then the Hypocrits: Publicans and Harlots ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before them: It is true we read of the converſion of ſome of them, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> But very few. Therefore, by all means take heed of Hypocriſie. Down right honeſty here is our beſt Policy.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Though their Religion was but ane empty profeſſion, yet they were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proud of it, <hi>I thank God I am not like this man;</hi> though a beleever by the Spirit ought to diſcern things freely given him of God, yet he ought with all to conſider, that there are ſome graces, the more we have of them,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:35410:81"/>alwayes we are the more humble; the more of faith, the more of repentance, the more of ſelf denyal, alwayes the more humble; and when any comes to be puft up with their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they are too like the man who ſaid, <hi>Come ſee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> of whom he threatned to be avenged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Phariſies were generally great oppoſers and blaſphemers of Chriſt, in whom alone the remedy of their other ſins was only to be found. And thus, like ſick men, they did ſpill and caſt over their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. This was the cop-ſtone of all their other ſins; poſſibly thou will ſay, herein thou out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtryps them; I will deſire thou will ſearch again: Though Chriſt hath gained ſo much credit, as not to be openly blaſphemed among us, yet ſee if theſe things be not yet in reference to him among us, which were among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The negarives and omiſſions, of which the Phariſies were guilty, they did not eſteem him as God, they did not employ him as Mediator, they did not ſubmitt to his Lawes as King and Head of his Church; If I could inſiſt here, much of all theſe three is there amongſt us ſtill. May he not ſtill ſtand and cry, <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life, I am deſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:35410:82"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Phariſies were bitter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors of his followers. <hi>Paul</hi> went from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Letters from them to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> there is yet too much of this amongſtus. We pretend indeed often other things, as the ground of our quarrels with his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but really the root of the quarrel is here, that they are his Diſciples, following his Lawes and his Commandments.</p>
            <p>Now, if ye would exceed their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs, eſpecially labour to exceed them in a high eſteem of Chriſt, giving him much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, ſubmitting to him as your King and Law giver; and take on his yok; and this will help with ſtrength for exceeding them in all thereſt.</p>

            <p>THe occaſion of theſe words is this, King <hi>Agrippa</hi> comeing to <hi>Ceſarea</hi> to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut <hi>Feſtus,</hi> the Roman Deputy in <hi>Judea,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:35410:82"/>where <hi>Paul</hi> was priſoner, is deſirous to hear him plead before him. And after <hi>Paul</hi> had given a very rational account of his being a Chriſtian; he could not be disobedient to the heavenly Viſion, and ſhewed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonancy of his doctrine to the writtings of the Prophets, <hi>I know,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>thou beleeveſt the Prophets,</hi> yea he threaps it upon him that he beleeved them; The words read contain <hi>Agrippa's</hi> reply, <hi>Thou almoſt,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words, there be theſe things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, 1 A preface prefixed by Luke, <hi>Then Agrippa ſaid unto Paul.</hi> 2dly, A confeſſion; that he was <hi>perſwaded to be a Chriſtian.</hi> 3dly, A limitation or reſtriction of this confeſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in a <hi>little</hi> only, or <hi>almoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who this <hi>Agrippa</hi> was, it will not make much for the ſcop I deſigne to inſiſt upon: He was the Son of that <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi> who cutt off the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> King of <hi>Chalcis,</hi> though afterward by his favour with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperour he obtained a larger tetrarchy: Ha had been brought up in the Jewiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, upon which account Paul looks upon him as one that beleeved the Prophets.</p>
            <p>There are two words in the Greek very Emphatick, the one tranſlated to <hi>perſwade,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies a cable-tow, it imports as much as by the force of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35410:83"/>
               <hi>Paul's</hi> diſcourſe he was drawen to Chriſtianity as with a cable-tow; the grounds were ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which <hi>Paul</hi> produced; the writtings of the Prophets, and the viſion upon the way that <hi>Paul</hi> told him of, drew him ſo ſtrongly, yet he yeelds only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tranſlats it, <hi>Modica ex parte,</hi> the old Latin ſeems to be better <hi>in modico,</hi> in a little, and thus farr drawen only to be Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which firſt the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians had at <hi>Antioch; Agrippa</hi> mentiones it; yt was at this time, as it is ſtill, very odious to the Heathens; But counted very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt the Chriſtians themſelves, ſeeing derived from the excellent Name of Chriſt, And certainly thoſe who are almoſt aſhamed of this ſo ancient and ſo honourable a name, and will needs be denominat from the Name <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Jeſuits, are to be juſtly taxed, as if they were aſhamed of the name Chriſtian, which even in <hi>Agrippa's</hi> time was common to Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And truely, it is very remarkable how Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits themſelves differ about the original and riſe of this name of theirs ſome of them, as <hi>Ribadeineira</hi> in <hi>vita Ignatii,</hi> tels us of a Viſion made to <hi>Ignatius</hi> their Founder, that gave a ryſe to it; but though this Viſion, which hath many ridiculous incredible paſſages, be talked of by ſeveral of them; yet others
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35410:83"/>count it ridiculous, and therefore <hi>Montaigue</hi> the Jeſuit repels it, and aſcribs it to the Pope, which he thinks as infallible as if it had been a Viſion from Heaven.</p>
            <p>They are no leſs devided about the Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of it; all of them aggree not about it. And Proteſtants finding them jarring how to find its original; ſome thinks a letter may be taken away and in ſtead of Jeſuits, they may be called <hi>Eſauits.</hi> Some think a letter may be added and they called <hi>Jebuſits:</hi> But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traverſie not fuiting this work, I will only touch the objection of <hi>Gretſerus,</hi> who tells us ſince all Chriſtians are denominat from the Name of Chriſt, as here in the Text, why may not their order be denominat from the Name of Jeſus? <hi>Hoſpinianus</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtorica Jeſuitica</hi> gives him a clear reply to this, that beleivers being by faith united to Chriſt are partakers of his unction as the Oyl <hi>Aaron</hi> was anoynted with, which run down on his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But we are not ſharers with him in his ſaveing his people from their ſins, from which is the Name Jeſus. But I cannot inſiſt on this.</p>
            <p>Haveing thus cleared the words, I come to take the Obſervation from them I purpoſe to inſiſt on, which is this.</p>
            <p>Obſervation, <hi>That though Chriſtian Religion ſtand upon moſt rational grounds, vet ſome are but almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians, even within the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="156" facs="tcp:35410:84"/>
            <p>This Obſervation is clear here, <hi>Agrippa</hi> was trained in the Jewiſh Religion, and he confeſſes he was drawn as with a cable-tow, and yet almoſt or in a little he was a Chriſtian only.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this point it ſhall be needleſs to inſiſt in proſecuting the rational grounds upon which Chriſtian Religion ſtands. Which, among the Fathers <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtin</hi> have done at great length, in their debats with Heathens. And in the reformed Church, eminent <hi>Du Pleſſe,</hi> in his Book <hi>De veritate Chriſtianae Religionis.</hi> Doctor <hi>Jakſon,</hi> in his unreaſonableneſs of unbeleife. Yea, even among the Papiſts, <hi>parſons</hi> in his Chriſtian reſolution; in theſe there are ſo many rational grounds ſet down, from the ſupernatural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the Goſpel; from the penmen of it, from the miracles whereby it was confirmed, from the voices from Heaven whereby it is atteſted, as are ſufficient to convince a Heathen of the reaſonableneſs of it.</p>
            <p>Yea, if we ſhould only take notice of that Argument whereby <hi>Agrippa</hi> was almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in the Text, which Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> hath amplified at ſome length, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> what conſiderable weight is there into it; A young man in a way to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, among the Phariſies eminently learned, <hi>Feſtus</hi> told him he had too much of it, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:35410:84"/>ſo that the Barbarians judged him for that, one of their Gods, ingadged not only by his former practiſes but by his preſent reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and ingadgment to the Phariſies to perſecute the Chriſtians, and yet by a voice from heaven to be ſuddenly changed, as to become a painful promotter of it, and to loſe ſo much for it, and at laſt cheerfully to ſeal the truth of it with his blood, was it any thing ſtrange that this did draw <hi>Agrippa</hi> as with a cable-tow to be a Chriſtian? But in thoſe and many moe that are commonly brought I ſhall not inſiſt. Only in proſecuting the point, I ſhall propoſe theſe things to be followed. 1. I ſhall prove by ane induction of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances, that though Chriſtian Religion ſtand upon ſo rational grounds yet many are but almoſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Chriſtians. 2dly, Shall enquire whence it is that it is ſo. 3dly, Shall apply the point.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> There be theſe inſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which a great multitude, who are but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chriſtians may be comprehended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a multitude deny many of the very foundamentals of Chriſtian Religion, as the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, which <hi>Socinians</hi> doe; the deity of Chriſt, as <hi>Arians</hi> doe; the humanity of Chriſt, as <hi>Neſtorians</hi> doe. Yea, not to inſiſt in particulars, any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in the leaſt, either with ancient or
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35410:85"/>modern Hiſtories of the tenets of divers He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, will find what a multitude of the fundamentals of it, have been queſtioned and denyed; and ſo they but almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be Chriſtians, who have denyed them.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Some though they deny not Chriſts ſatisfaction, yet they joyn togither their own works and duties with Chriſts ſatisfaction, as cauſes of juſtification before God, and ſo there is ſomewhat aſcribed to Chriſt, but not all; they are Chriſtians in ſome part; this is the common opinion and doctrine of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and the practiſe of many Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Such are guilty of this, who leave or embrace the Law of Chriſt as it maks for or againſt them; the leſſer duties they goe about, and if God will be content with what they can ſpare, they are content to give it him: But for the greater duties of the Law, or ſuch as have any difficulty in them, with theſe they can diſpenſe, except the ſhew of practiſing theſe can promove their intereſt. Under this Head what a multitude are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended!</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Time-ſervers in Religion come alſo under this, to be almoſt Chriſtians, who change their Religion with every ſpet and current, that ſet their watch according as the toun clock they dwell into goes, theſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35410:85"/>are but almoſt Chriſtians. They are led by example and the practiſe of the multitude in their way, and not by any of the precepts of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Such as profeſs Chriſt but are given up to the Common ſins and ſcandalous outbreakings that Chriſt hath ſo ſtraitly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, haveing eyes full of adultery, their faces inflammed with wyne, that declare their fin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſuch, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt, <hi>They profeſs they know God, but in works they deny him, being reprobat unto every good work.</hi> Now how many are there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt, that are in one of theſe fyve but almoſt, or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, perſwaded to be Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Second</hi> we propoſed, whence it is that, ſince Chriſtian Religion is ſo rational, ſo many are but almoſt Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>For clearing this, 1. There be ſomethings that are proper cauſes of it, haveing a proper cauſal influence upon it. 2dly, Somethings that are but cauſes, by accident, of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt, That are proper cauſes of it,</hi> we ſhall name but theſe fyve.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, There may be a ſpecious outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, where there is a great deal of Atheiſme within. The whiſperings of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, and the fear of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, may cauſe one take on a profeſſion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:35410:86"/>of Chriſt, and where Atheiſm is, no wonder one be but in ſomethings a Chriſtian: For 1. The fundamental principle that leads to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the commands of any deity, is the faith of his being. If this be queſtioned, who will regard the command? <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt beleeve that God is;</hi> yea all the incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to duty, and all the threatnings againſt ſin, are undervalued, where the faith of the being of God is wanting; If this be not, they are but as deviſed fables. Now take away the encouragements from promiſes and threatnings, and ye take off the pace, that which makes the wheels goe. No wonder then but almoſt a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Many are but almoſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians, becauſe of the unbeleefe that the Scriptures have proceeded from God, and conſequently cannot hold true: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they own a profeſſion of Chriſt, like <hi>Gallio</hi> who accounted the queſtion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection only a queſtion of names and words. That the Scripture are given by divine inſpiration, and that they are ſurer then Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, are things not credited. <hi>Paul</hi> moved a queſtion, if <hi>Agrippa</hi> beleeved the Prophets. No wonder then he was but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The heart in many is wedded to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts, whichlyes as a mountain in the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:35410:86"/>way of their becoming altogither Chriſtians. Man hath but one ſoule, and cannot leave it to two contrarieties in any benſil, the love of the World and the love of the Father are inconſiſtant, like fyre and water, they expel one another out of the ſame ſubject, deſire of the World is ſo great, and men ſo intent upon it, that when Chriſt calls he is not heard, or in part only.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Moſt of the principles in man are contradictory to the principles layd in the Goſpel. Let us take but a ſhort view of ſome of them. 1. Self-love is natural to man. <hi>When thou does well unto thy ſelf, all men will praiſe thee.</hi> But it is one of the firſt leſſons that he that is Chriſt's Diſciple learnes, <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him deny himſelf.</hi> 2dly, It is natural to men to love, eaſe, the Goſpel puts him to labour, <hi>ſtryve, take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence.</hi> 3dly, Nature teacheth men to eſteem much of things preſent, as more certain then theſe that are abſent and to come; it is contrary quite here, theſe things, that are <hi>preſent</hi> are but ſhaddows compared with thoſe that are <hi>abſent.</hi> 4thly, Doe, and be happy, is a principle nature teaches to men, <hi>What shall I doe to be ſaved?</hi> Renounce it, and truſt in what another hath done to make us happy is taught here; a multitued of ſuch contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:35410:87"/>principles are natural to us. Now where there is ſuch contradiction in principles: No wonder many be but almoſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, Tentations from Sathan and the World have a cauſal influence upon thoſe, <hi>If this Goſpel be hide, it is hide to theſe whoſe eyes the God of this World hath blinded.</hi> Though Sathan beleive himſelf and tremble <hi>James</hi> 2. yet he knowes it is much for the deſigne he is advancing in the World, to keep men off from coming over wholly to Chriſt. Beſide, man is a creature much led by example, and given to imitation, and often ungodly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if they doe not more, yet they blunt his zeal and keeps back from altogither being a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe things which have a proper cauſal influence on many's being but almoſt Chriſtians: There be other things that by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident occaſion this.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> Many of the contents of the Goſpel are altogither ſupernatural; <hi>Mahomet</hi> his Lawes were ſuited well to mans corrupt nature; ſo were theſe which <hi>Apolonius Lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> gave to the Heathens: But here, if we ſhall either look to the duties or promiſes of the Goſpel, they are altogither ſupernatural. 1. The duties are ſupernatural. as beleeve, deny thy ſelf, take up thy croſs, deſpiſe things preſent; the promiſes are alſo of this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:35410:87"/>nature; if they were but ſuch as theſe had under the law, ſuch as if any man come not up to the feaſt of Tabernacles the rain ſhall not fall upon his land, how would this make many run to ordinances, who are nothing moved with the promiſes, of being in Chriſt, joy in the Holy Choſt, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>Beſide <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the contents of the Goſpel are ſupernatural, ſo muſt they be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally diſcerned; as mere ſenſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties cannot reach the objects of reaſon, a man cannot with his eyes ane argument, ſo ſuch as are truly rational cannot reach what is purely ſpiritual without illumination from the Spirit, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8: 7. <hi>The wiſdome of the flesh is enemity againſt God, neither can it be ſubject to the Law of God,</hi> for it is ſpiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>From all theſe it comes to paſs that many are but almoſt Chriſtians. But I goe to the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is it ſo that many are but almoſt Chriſtians? It ſerves for humiliation to all ſuch as are but almoſt ſo. I ſhall not inſiſt in proſecuting this uſe in reference to ſuch as are ſo in point of doctrine, in regard all of us own ſuch doctrinal principles as lead us up to be altogither Chriſtians, but ſhall follow it in reference to ſuch as are ſo in point of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:35410:88"/>of how many may the Lord complain as he did of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſea, 7: 8. <hi>Ephraim is a cake unturned,</hi> that is raw on the one ſide and baken on the other; In ſomethings, Chriſtians, eſpecially ſuch things as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with their intereſt, but in other things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, eſpecially ſuch things as are moſt difficult, and of moſt abſolut neceſſity. And that this uſe of humiliation may prove the more preſſing, we ſhall offer theſe things to evidence what manner of humiliation is meet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is in reſting upon the being almoſt a Chriſtian a ſecret contempt of God. He that cuts and carves upon the lawes of his Soveraigne, taking what makes for him, and rejecting what he pleaſes, contemnes the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that enjoyned them: To doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the command of God, and to reject others, muſt flow either from ſome apparent iniquity in the Law, which is a high reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a deſpiſing of the authority that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned it, and both reflect on God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To be in part a Chriſtian, and not altogither, is a temper God loaths. This was the temper of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which was neither cold nor hot, lukewarme, which hath ſome degrees of heat and ſome of cold; and he threatens he will ſpew her out of his mouth as one doth a thing his ſtomache loaths.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:35410:88"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This puts a man to ſerve two maſters, to be in ſome things for God, and in ſomethings for his enemie, <hi>A double minded man,</hi> ſayeth James, <hi>is unſtable in all his wayes,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a man that hath a minde and a minde, he muſt be like Iſrael in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, halting betwixt two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> one may loſs Heaven, though he doe much for God, for not doeing more, there are ſome things abſolutly neceſſary for ſalvation, if we ſhould be never ſo righteous in our dealing with men, <hi>yet he that beleeves not is condemned already, becauſe he bath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Now how lamentable is it to doe much for Chriſt, and yet come ſhort of Heaven for not doeing more?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This, to be in part a Chriſtian, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives a man for the preſent of the ſweeteſt part of Chriſtian Religion; the peace and joy promiſed in the Goſpel is attained by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the moſt in ward duties of it, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of which makes many find godlineſs a kinde of <hi>Labyrinth</hi> to them, they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually breaking ſhells that hath no kirnel in them.</p>
            <p>All theſe laid togither evidence what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of humiliation ariſeth from this, to be almoſt only a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe ſecond,</hi> Is it ſo that many are but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:35410:89"/>moſt Chriſtians, then in the next place, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour thou to be not only almoſt but altogither a Chriſtian. In this Uſe I ſhall 1ſt Open to you the ſcope I dryve at into it. 2dly, Give you ſome directions for promoving it.</p>
            <p>The ſcope of it is not <hi>Firſt,</hi> To preſs you to eſhew a manger I hotchpotch Kinde of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſuch as ſometimes the <hi>Jewes</hi> had of old, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have of late. I ſhall ſuppoſe our tentations, bleſſed be the Lord, ſhall not carry to ſo great ane evil as this. Neither, 2dly, Is the ſcope of this uſe to condemne that Chriſtian moderation which in leſſer truths may be ſomtimes very profitable, for the peace of the Church. Neither, 3dly, Is it to condemne all kinds of zeal in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our greater duties in Chriſtian Religion, which ought alwayes to be regulat with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge. Neither, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Doe we ſuppoſe that a Chriſtian in this life can reach ane abſolut perfection in his Chriſtian courſe, without any defect at all. At theſe things this uſe does not drive.</p>
            <p>But it drives at preſſing theſe things. 1 To exhort all, while they are eſhewing ſome ſins in practice, whereby they become in part Chriſtians, that they ſitt not down content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eldy there, while they are practiſing others no leſs dangerous. While they eſhewe, for inſtance, ſcandalous breach of the Sabboth,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35410:89"/>they doe not contendedly practiſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, naked formality. Or, 2dly, While there is the practiſe of ſome duties whereby one becomes almoſt a Chriſtian, and not far from the Kingdome of God, there be not a voluntary neglect of others poſſibly more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Or, 3dly, To exhort the eſhewing the practice of Chriſtianity at ſometimes, when there is the quite contrary at another time, ebbing and flowing in Chriſtianity, as the Sea with the courſe of the Moon, ſerving times and occaſions with our Religion, and not keeping ane even pace, at theſe the point dryves; and that we may be helped thus to labour to be not only almoſt but altogither Chriſtians, I ſhall offer theſe following di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſtian, labour to be very ſerious in the performance of holy duties, be careful to joyne therein <hi>attention of minde,</hi> Ezek: 33. verſ. 32. <hi>Singleneſs; of heart,</hi> Pſal. 145: 18. <hi>Intention of affection,</hi> Rom. 12: 11. <hi>Holy fear and reverence,</hi> Heb 12: 18 The want of theſe makes even our Religious duties to be performed but almoſt as Chriſtians: There is not that reverence of God in them, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that intercourſe and communion, with God, which they that endevour to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither Chriſtians doe attain. Therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well the nature of God whoſe ſervice it
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:35410:90"/>is; <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> Mal. 1. <hi>v,</hi> laſt. <hi>His Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Jer. 48: 10. Conſider the nature of the ſervice wherein thou hes to doe with him. Conſider them as duties and a part of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, not parts of thy Chriſtian liberty. Conſider them as priviledges, as indeed they are, as talents of which thou art to give ane account to God. Theſe and ſuch like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may influence more ſeriouſneſs in our performances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If thou would not be almoſt but altogither a Chriſtian, Labour to get right thoughts of God, eſpecially in theſe three. 1. In his <hi>Alſufficiency,</hi> Gen. 17: 1. And that would keep thy heart ſteady and fixed in Religion. God is our happineſs and not the creatur. And therefore whither more or leſs of the creature, it comes all to one, if God be ours. Next, the faith of his <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence, Pſal.</hi> 139: 6, 7. This will aw us when we have ſecret opportunities and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39: 9. It will poſſeſs with godly fear and reverence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 10. <hi>It will comforty in afflictions, Pſal.</hi> 23: 4. 3dly, Of his <hi>univerſal providence,</hi> extending it ſelf to every thing that comes to paſſe, even the leaſt things, <hi>Math.</hi> 10: 28. Beſide the occaſions we ſhall have hereby to adore the <hi>perfections of God, Job.</hi> 37: 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107: 43. <hi>It will help to thankfulneſs, Pſal.</hi> 40: 5. And keep
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35410:90"/>from <hi>abuſe of mercies, Hoſea</hi> 2: v. 8. To ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit patiently to afflictions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3: 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To avoid this, be very careful not to neglect known duties. Uſually in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical</hi> divinity, the plaineſt truths are leaſt ſtudied, becauſe they are taken for granted, It is often ſo in practicals, our zeal ſpent on things that are moſt doubtful, when clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged duties are neglected, as it was with the <hi>Jewes, Micha</hi> 6: 7. They were careful to enquire when they ſhould faſt, but neglected the duties of moral equity. The beſt way, as one obſerves well, to know more of the minde of God in what is duobt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, is to be buſſy in doing what is clear, <hi>John</hi> 7: v. 17. He is the beſt Chriſtian that is moſt in the fundamentals of a Chriſtians duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Every night take ane account of the paſſages of the day, and examine what the ſtrain of the heart hath been, what you have done, and upon what grounds, for what ends, what ye have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; hereby ye come to know what ground ye gain of your corruption, how long time yely in any ſin unrepented of. This record or journal of our dayly walkings hath been the practiſe of many Godly men, as the writters of the records of their lives have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and there is nothing, will tend more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35410:91"/>to prevent our reſting upon being almoſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Propoſe the perfect patterne of Chriſts life before you. It is true all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt are not imitable; He was not a mere man, but God and man, and what he did as God or as Mediator betwixt God and man, we cannot imitat, but there are divers things wherein the Scriptures expreſly propoſes him as ane example, as <hi>love, Eph.</hi> 5: v, 12. <hi>Meekneſs.</hi> Matth. 11: 29. <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> Phil. 2: 3. <hi>Patiencs,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 21. <hi>Making it his work to doe good,</hi> Acts 10: 38. This ſerves not only for our example, but for our incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. There is nothing he calls us to but he did it, and is now crowned. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers all the weight can be layed on any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from men; Since his is one of the greateſt, wiſeſt, nobleſt that can be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If thou would indeed be above the being only almoſt a Chriſtian, then labour to doe all thou does in the name of Chriſt, the ſtreſſe of Chriſtianity lyes in this, <hi>Col.</hi> 3: <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. to eye the authority of Chriſt as commanding or forbidding what we are or are not called to, Math. 21: 23. John 5: 43. To doe in the ſtrength of Chriſt Mark 16: 17. Acts 3: 12. And to doe for the ſake of Chriſt, as for his honour. All theſe three are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in doeing in his name.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:35410:91"/>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, if we labour to come up to ſo much exactneſs as theſe rules would carry us to, we have done with a mirry life in the world, and muſt goe under the repute of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, that I may not too farr tranſgreſs time, only in anſwer to this ſay one thing. Labour to know the true bounds of thy Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian liberty, not that ye walk to the uttermoſt extent of it, for the ſatisfying of your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and carnal deſires; but that you lay nothing in your Chriſtian courſe to make Chriſts yoke weightier then he himſelf hath made it; from the want of the knowledge of this ariſes ſo many groundleſs cenſures of others, &amp; caſting them out of our charity, for the practice of things wherein Chriſt poſſibly hath allowed them a liberty. The knowledge of this would make us indeavour in many things to pleaſe our neighbour to his edification, <hi>Rom</hi> 15: 2. In a word, if thou know not this, thy work in Chriſtianity may be more burdenſome then thou art awarr of. So follow theſe directions, and by the bleſſing of God, thou may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſomewhat more then <hi>Agrippa</hi> who was only, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, almoſt a Chriſtian.</p>

            <p>THe Hiſtory of <hi>Abraham</hi> his offering <hi>Iſaak</hi> is famous, both amongſt ſacred and prophane writters; The introduction to it, or rather a compend of the whole Hiſtory, we have now read.</p>
            <p>The words have dependance on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter, in which we have <hi>Abraham</hi> treating with <hi>Abimelech</hi> as one Prince doth with another; and <hi>after theſe things,</hi> after the Lord had made him ſo great as to be ſought to by Princes; <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the firſt Book of his <hi>Antiquities, Chap.</hi> 14 tells us, that before the Lord told him of the ſacrifice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Iſaack,</hi> that He reckoned up to him all the mercies He had from tyme to tyme beſtowed on him, and after theſe tempted him.</p>
            <p>And in the tentation there are three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars remarkable, 1ſt, The tyme of it:
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:35410:92"/>2dly, The Author it: And, 3dly, The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur of it. The tyme of it, <hi>After theſe things.</hi> The Author of it, <hi>God.</hi> The nature of it was atentation, <hi>God tempted Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pererius</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> on the place goes near to tax <hi>Moſes</hi> as defective in not reckoning what age <hi>Iſaack</hi> was of when this came to paſs, and he ſpends a great deal of tyme in confuting <hi>Abenezra,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Iſaack</hi> was but 12. years old; and in proving the common opinion that he was, 15. but we not looking on this as material, it is ſufficient the tyme is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as it is <hi>After theſe things,</hi> after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo great mercies beſtowed on Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>God tempted him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only conſiderable difficulty in the words, is, to reconcile this place with that of <hi>James</hi> 1: 13. <hi>Let no man ſay, when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God, God tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man,</hi> and here God tempted <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Paſſing the flooriſhes of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling theſe two places, there is this one ſolide anſwer. There is a tempting by way of <hi>tryal,</hi> and a tempting by way of <hi>ſeducement,</hi> God tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> with the firſt kinde of tentation, and <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of the ſecond kinde of tentations, that ſeduce and lead to ſin, as is evident, firſt, from the word uſed by the Apoſtle there, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So here, <hi>after theſe things, Abraham was tempted.</hi> And the conſtant tract of providence from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> proves the truth of it, yea ſcarcely in Scripture one inſtance (which is rare in providential actings) againſt it. For 1. Great mercies are often accompanied with great abuſes, and therefore no wonder fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with great tryals. The Lord does ſometymes to his vineyard till he come to ſay, <hi>What can I do more,</hi> and yet <hi>ſour Graps, Iſai:</hi> 5. What wonder then he pluck downe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:35410:93"/>his hedge! Beſide all that receive mercies doe not receive them with the like integrity, they fall ſometimes as ſome drops of rain that only makes a thiſtle or weeds to grow, and therefore need of winnowing by tentations. Yea, 2dly, Uſually thoſe who are moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving mercies from God, are moſt invyed by Sathan; ye ſhall find him in Scripture chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Gods greateſt favourits and following them moſt with his tentations, ſuch as <hi>Job, David, Aſaph, Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> I ſhall not dwell on this point, only doe not think God is out of the road way of his providence when he does this, whither to his Church or particular perſons; It is ane inlet to all apoſtaſie to be pleaſed with nothing but mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies here away from God: If thou hath at this Sacrament taſted of <hi>Abraham's</hi> manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it ſhall be ſtrange, if after theſe things it come not to paſs that thou taſt of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> tentations. Our roſe here muſt have thornes beſide it: and therefore, ſay thou, ſhall we receive good of the hands of the Lord, and not evil alſo? And bleſs him in both.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. II. <hi>That it is very neceſſary when we remember or mention the tentations God expoſes his people to, to remember alſo the mercies he beſtowes on them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> here, God tempted him, but it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:35410:94"/>is after theſe things. So the Church at length in the <hi>third</hi> of the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> ſo <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo <hi>David Pſalm.</hi> 44. and there is good reaſon for it. For 1. This tends to keep up honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts of God. If there be nothing minded but the tentations, we are ready to count of him, as the man who had the one talent, auſtere and rigorous. Beſide, this tends to keep us from fainting under tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13: 5. It may be often the Lords quarrel with us in tryals, which he had with Iſrael at the red Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. <hi>They conſidered not the multitude of his mercies, but at the Sea, even the red Sea, they provocked him.</hi> The firſt tryal they met with they ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat all the Lord had done for them in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Many pore only upon their diſcouragements, eſpecially in tryals or at <hi>Sacraments,</hi> like one that would be broding himſelf with the bryar of his role, and not ſmelling the roſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Haman</hi> was a foole to quarrel that <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay</hi> bowed not his knee to him, ſince he was ſo much in the Kings ſavour, he might have deſpiſed <hi>Mordecayes.</hi> What ever beſal the Church of God or thyſelf, ſtill remember it is after theſe things.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. III. <hi>That tryals and afflictions are rightly looked upon by us, when we look upon them as tentations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Abraham's</hi> tryal, here called a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:35410:94"/>
               <hi>James</hi> 1: 2. <hi>My Brethren count it all joy when ye fall in divers tentations.</hi> The Apoſtle means afflictions, but thinks fitt to repreſent it to them under the notion of tentation; So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 6. <hi>Though now for a ſeaſon ye be in heavineſs, through manifold tentations:</hi> It was the croſs was on them, but the Apoſtle calls them tentations: And there are ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why afflictions are ſo called, which are worthy to be remarked.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our tryals often are nothing but tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, our diſcouraged Spirits creates fears and then toſſes them ſo, that one in wreſtling with their own thoughts will ſuffer more then another on whom the croſſe is indeed inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And here by the way, it is worthy to be noted, how often we are in the wronge to God ſuſpecting him for his providence, when in the mean tyme it is but a conflict with our own apprehenſions: Like <hi>Hagar</hi> who was complaining for the want of water, and yet cloſe beſide a fountain, but her eyes were not opened to ſee it.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Trials are called tentations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the principal and chief ſcope of affliction is to winnow and try, <hi>That the tryal of your faith, being more pretious then gold,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 7. the Apoſtle points our their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there from the principal ſcop of it. And here I would have you take notice of theſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35410:95"/>three things. 1. Though God know us well enough, and though Saints try themſelves, yet we have need to be tryed by affliction. There is a myſtery of iniquity as well as there is a myſtery of godlineſs, oftentymes in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is ſomething diſcovered to us, which for all our ſearch of ourſelves we could not have found out, nor have beleeved had been in us: like a pool troubled, ſo are our hearts in affliction, their comes up mud which we would not have thought to have been there. Yea, 2dly, As the Lord delights in the graces of his Saints, ſo he loves to have ſome occaſion to commend them in his Saints, <hi>He ſtill retaineth his integrity, though thou moveſt me without a cauſe againſt him;</hi> See how he boaſteth of <hi>Job,</hi> as a Maſter when a good Scholler is examined. Therefore he loves to try by affliction, that He may have occaſion to ſay, <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi> 3dly, The Lord loves to diſcover his people to others. For 1. By thy example, others may be encouraged; What is the end of the Lords recording the valorous acts of his Saints, their reward is full without this, but to incourage others? Yea, if thou faint in a tryal, others may be bettered by it. Why hath the Lord recorded in Scripture the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſome of his Saints? Is it that the Lord loves to blot their names when they are
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:35410:95"/>gone? No certainly: but that thou may reaſon for thy comfort, if ſuch a Cedar was blowen over by the wind, though I be ſo, I need not deſpair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Afflictions are cailed tentations, becauſe there is no affliction, but it alſo hath a tentation accompanying it. And the Lord does not ſo try by the affliction it ſelfe, as by the tentation that accompanyes it; See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31: 22. and the 2d of <hi>Jonah,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And here alſo I would have thir things conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in every affliction a beleever hath a double advantadge by looking on his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as accompanied with a tentation: 1ſt, Hereby he guards againſt the ſtrongeſt adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaty he hath in his tryal; Some get the victory over the affliction that yet are taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by the tentation that accompanied the affliction, as all that turne aſide to ſinful courſes to cſhew the croſſe are. Yea, 2dly, We by this guard againſt the greateſt hazard from affliction; The leaſt ſin is worſe then the greateſt croſſe; And if we guard againſt the tentation of the affliction, we are keeped from the ſin that Sathan by the affliction dryves at, as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe he did at that, that he ſhould curſe God and die.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Whatever be the deſigne of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſecondary cauſes in our affliction,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:35410:96"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:35410:97"/>yet it is certain Sathan, who uſes to take the advantage of our affliction in miſrepreſenting God to us, deſigns principally that we ſhould be overcome by the tentation of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And a beleever comes bravely through his tryal, when he can ſay as <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 18. (which <hi>Pſalme</hi> was penned when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and from <hi>Saul,</hi> as the title of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bears,) <hi>I was alſo upright before him, and I keeped me from my iniquity.</hi> The ſcope and uſe of this point is to preſs the people of God to look aright on their afflictions as having tentations accompanying them. Ye are all fearing a cloud gathering and are ready to be perplexed with the difficulty ye forecaſt; But be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to look moſt to the tentations: this warning Chriſt gave his Diſciples when he was about to ſuffer, <hi>watch and pray, that ye enter not into tentation:</hi> he ſayes not, <hi>into af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,</hi> but <hi>into tentatione.</hi> And they are guarding beſt againſt the croſſe they fear, that are moſt in prayer, <hi>Lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from all evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſervat. IV. <hi>That a beleever muſt not only expect tentations from Sarhan, but from God,</hi> God tempted Abraham after theſe things, <hi>ſo Deut</hi> 13: 3.</p>
            <p>I marke this point becauſe ſome, if they take up a tryal under the notion of a tentation,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35410:97"/>they think it their duty preſently to lay it aſide. It is true, if it lead to ſin, it is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to do ſo; but if it tend to diſcovery of ſin or grace, that is not thy duty. I ſhall not inſiſt on this point, only offer three charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how ye may diſcern betwixt tentations from God and from Sathan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Uſually God in his tentation aſſaults moſt the outward man, ſome duty that is heavy to the Fleſh, as to <hi>Job, David,</hi> and others, whom he tempted, and here to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> It is true, Sathan ſometimes aſſaults the body, but then as ſome archers he ſeems to look one way and ſhoots another, his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt is againſt the Spirit principally, <hi>curſe God and die,</hi> he barks only at the outward man, but his byt is deeper, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> he winnowed him that he might deny his maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They may be diſtinguiſhed by the manner of their procedour, uſually when God tempts, it is to ſomewhat that nature loaths, as here to <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer his Son, his only Son: Sathans practick, divyns ſay, obſerves what way the tree bends, and ſhaks it that way, ſuiting his tentations to our incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God alwayes attains his end that he tempts for, if diſcovery of grace, or of weakneſs, or corruption, or what elſe; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:35410:98"/>may winnow, as he did <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet his faith not fail.</p>
            <p>But that I may come to the laſt Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I purpoſe a litle more largerly to inſiſt upon, it is one which I find both Popiſh and Proteſtant Interpreters on the place, take notice of, partly out of Scripture, and partly out of ſome Jewiſh Doctors, <hi>Abraham</hi> had ten tryals before, as, To forſake his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; To flee again and again to <hi>Aegrpt,</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> where his life was in hazard: He had controverſies with his Friends; as with <hi>Lot,</hi> for wells; diviſion in his Family, <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> and their Children wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; He was put to wreſtle with four Kings for <hi>Lot,</hi> and many ſuch; Yet none of theſe goes under the name of tentation, till it come to this, the offering up of <hi>Iſaack, then</hi> God tempted <hi>Abraham,</hi> not before, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all theſe tryals, and ſo this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords us a new foundation for that Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I will inſiſt a litle upon.</p>
            <p>Obſervat. V. <hi>That though the Lord often exerciſe his people with leſſer tryals, yet be uſually reſerves ſome great one for them, that may be fully called a tentation, or, a leaſt, after many tryals, one may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for us of ſuch a nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is often Gods way by leſſer tryals to firt us for greater. I deny not but ſometymes
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:35410:98"/>he will meaſure out to ſome of his people their difficulty by ſmalls, tender plants a flood togither would drown them, which being diſtilled by drops makes them grow and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But often with others, this is his way, by leſſer tryals to prepare them for greater, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3: 10. <hi>I will keep thee in the hour of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> that ſeems to relat to ſome ſignal tryal, which by a ſpecial deſignation may goe under the name of a tentation.</p>
            <p>I will not goe to ſearch after reaſons of this, how it may make for his honour, and how his peoples caſe may ſometimes require it ſhould be ſo. Only <hi>I</hi> ſhall enquire what ſhould be the ingredients of which a tryal is compoſed when it may fittly be denominat a tentation; and in ſearching this I ſhall confine my ſelf to this tryal of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> in which, as learned interpreters obſerve, there was a threefold aſſault on <hi>Abraham</hi> all at once, 1. On his <hi>faith.</hi> 2dly, On his <hi>obedience.</hi> 3dly, On his <hi>love</hi> to his neareſt relations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In this tentation <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was aſſaulted. <hi>Abraham</hi> had received two promiſes in reference to <hi>Iſaack.</hi> In <hi>Iſaack shall thy ſeed be called;</hi> and <hi>in thy ſeed shall all the Nations of the world be bleſſed:</hi> And yet now at one ſtroak, both thoſe promiſes ſeems to be plucked up by the root; might not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> have ſaid what <hi>Aſaph</hi> ſayes in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35410:99"/>
               <hi>What is become of the promiſe? Abrahams</hi> faith hes nothing to leane to, but the power of God, <hi>He knew God was able,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. verſ. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His obedience is no leſs tryed then his faith. For 1. He is put upon a thing that was contrary to a part of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Thou shalt not kill:</hi> Blood hath a cry, eſpecially the nearer the relation be that ſheds it, as <hi>Abels</hi> had when <hi>Cain</hi> killed him; it is the next degree to ſelf Murther, For a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to kill his own Son; ſo that <hi>Abraham</hi> hath not only a queſtion about the firmeneſs of the promiſe of God, and how his Command was conſiſtant with his promiſe, but how it was conſiſtant with his other commands, which by the light of nature were planted in the heart of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To make his tentation the greater, his love to his neareſt relations is brought on the ſtage alſo. Interpreters obſerve on the words of the following verſe to what we read, that every word hath a weight in it; <hi>take now thy ſone, thy only ſone Iſaack-whom thou loveſt, and offer him, for a brunt-offering.</hi> How great is the love of a Father to a <hi>Sone;</hi> eſpecialy if he be ane <hi>only</hi> Sone, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12: 10. they ſhall mourne as one doth for his <hi>only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi> There is weight in his name <hi>Iſaack,</hi> which ſignifies laughter, that the ſone and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:35410:99"/>the only ſone of his <hi>Fathers Laughter</hi> ſhould be offered in a brunt offering, where all is conſumed to aſhes, that was a tryal indeed.</p>
            <p>Now when theſe three concurr in any trial, that one is called to be denyed to his neareſt relations and to part with them, a miſt alſo upon the underſtanding darkning the mind as to their duety, and when they take them to the promiſes, as a drowning man to a buſh, the buſh ſeems to come, and they cannot ſee how to faſten on the promiſe, this makes a tryall that may fittly be called a tentation.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> By this kind of diſpenſation a beleever comes to be ſcourged with twiſted rods at once, as a load layd on above a burden. <hi>Job</hi> complained of his friends as cruell, that they would deall ſo unkindly, when Gods arrows were ſticking in him, <hi>have ye no compaſſione on me, my friends, for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath dealt bitterly with me.</hi> When one is put to quit with friends and promiſes at once, it is like the wind that fell upon all the corners of the houſe where <hi>Jobs</hi> children were feaſting: A man in ſuch a caſe is like <hi>Iſrael.</hi> who had the read ſea before them, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on every ſyd, and <hi>Egypt</hi> behind them.</p>
            <p>Beſide, <hi>Secondly,</hi> a tryall of this nature lets in affliction to the ſoul. <hi>David</hi> complains the waters had come into his ſoul. So long as a tryall affects only the outward man, it is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:35410:100"/>like a wound in the Arme, which proves not deadly, if the heart be not affected: but when the wound is at the heart, who can bear it. It is a pittifull account <hi>David</hi> gives of his caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116: 3. <hi>The cords of death hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, and the pains of hell took hold on me, I found trouble and ſorrow:</hi> trouble from <hi>Saul,</hi> who perſued him to death, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the pains of hell. Now when both a ſtroak on our outward condition &amp; ane other on our faith comes togither, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Hercules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traduos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is uſuall with man to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance any loſs by any ſtroak of affliction by ſomething he yet enjoyes or hopes for, as the cloud of witneſſes <hi>Heb.</hi> 11 did: many outward loſs, we uſe to comfort ourſelves from the promiſes; but when theſe ſeem to yeeld, it is like ane tree plucked up by the root that cuts off our hope of fruit afterward. How ſad is that complaint of <hi>Aſaphs, Pſalm</hi> 77. <hi>In the day of his trouble, his ſore rane in the night, and ceaſed not; I remembred God and was troubled.</hi> When his ſore is runing he thinks to find ane eaſe by remembering God, and that failing him, his Spirit was <hi>overwhelmed,</hi> as a boat in a ſtorme, for which no hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To evidence how great a tryall this is, conſider to what it hath driven many of the moſt excellent Sames of God, to ſpeak
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:35410:100"/>unadviſedly with their lips, to reflect on God, as one become cruell unto them, as <hi>Job,</hi> to brand his Servants the Prophets, as feeding them with lyes in ſtead of promiſes, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte all men are lyars, Samuel</hi> among the reſt, who had told him in Gods Name he ſhould be King; and many ſuch like in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſcope of this point is to put the people of God to forecaſt with greater trials then any they have poſſibly yet met with, when thou may be put to part with thy neareſt relations, and readily no ſmall aſſault upon thy mind at ſuch a time, it is true the Lord uſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his north wind to ceaſe in the day of the ſouth wind, and ſometimes it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; but we can loſs nothing by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for trials, that may fittly be called tentations. And I ſhall breifly ſhew you what incouragements he had under, this tentation and exhort you when your trials ſhall grow upon you, to imitat him in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Abraham</hi> had the call of God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter his tentation, <hi>God ſaid</hi> to him, take thy Sone, thy only Sone <hi>Iſaack;</hi> as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is not to ſitt the call of God, when called to trials, nor flee from it, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did; ſo he is not to rune to meet with the croſs before it come, and be called to it by
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:35410:101"/>God. There are ſome that like <hi>Goliah</hi> think themſelves able to encounter ane hoſt, who when he comes to the trial, a boy and a pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtone out of the brook will lay them on their back; the hope that <hi>his</hi> ſtrength will be <hi>ours</hi> under a trial, is only well grounded, when not our own ſimplicity or folly, or pride, or unconſideratneſs, but his call, hath brought us under it; when his truth calls for it, he calls us. A Man that hath the call of God knowes this that whatſoever the event of his trial be, he is about his duety, and there is a great deall of peace refulting from this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Abraham</hi> as he had the call of God to this tentation, ſo he had former experience of God to this tentatione, that what he called him to renounce he brought it well about in the event. He had called him to forſake his Fathers houſe, his countrey and kindred, to come among ſtrangers, and there he had made him a Prince for riches and honour. Now this is very comfortable under any great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione, when one can produce experiences of Gods way formerly to them, as <hi>Tamar</hi> did with <hi>Judah,</hi> when ſhe was by <hi>Judahs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand brought forth to be brunt, ſhe brought forth the ringe and the ſtaffe, and asked whoſe theſe are; ſhe ſaid as much as, will the man that gave me theſe things burne me. If
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:35410:101"/>thou ſay thou haſt not <hi>Abrahams</hi> experiences of this kind againſt a trial; certainly thou haſt not obſerved his way to thee if it be ſo; but if thou haſt none of thy own, take ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural-experiences of Gods way; and improve theſe under a tentatione, as the Church does, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. <hi>Our cars have heard our Fathers tell what great things, what great things, thou didſt of old.</hi> Even theſe are comfortable dounward to us, that we might ſet our hope in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly. Abraham</hi> was not ſo much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what might be ſaid againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes God made to him, as who he was that made them. Let <hi>Iſaack</hi> be brought to Ashes, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> will not ſtagger at the promiſe, ſo long as two attributs of God remain, he judged him faithful that had promiſed, and he knew that he was <hi>able</hi> out of the aſhes of <hi>Iſaack</hi> to accompliſh his promiſe. However in a tentatione the promiſe goe out of thy light ſo that thou art put to ſay, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the promiſe? Yet goe not to doubt of it, leſt thou queſtion or deny either that God is <hi>faithful</hi> or that he is <hi>able;</hi> &amp; O how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God is it to hazard on the credit of a promiſe of God, which is in appearance by providence as overturned, on the account of the faithfulneſs and power of God. Learn then to anſwer the objections againſt them as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35410:102"/>the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> does, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.4. <hi>In God will I praiſe his word, I will not fear what flesh can doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Abraham</hi> did ſhalte himſelf looſe of all the outward Impediments that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle him and imped his obedience to God in this tentation; he told not <hi>Sarah</hi> of it, and, as ſome Jewiſh Doctors relate, the cauſe of her death which followed ſhortly after <hi>Abraham</hi> came home, was the report of ſo ſtrange ane attempt by <hi>Abraham,</hi> how then would ſhe have taken it being told her before? Beſide, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſaid, at the foot of the mount, to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>abide ye here, and I and the lad will goe up to the mount;</hi> Ordinarly in tentations to which we are called, we are intangled by our too much conſulting with fleſh and blood, who alwayes give <hi>Peter</hi> his advice; but if we could ſhake our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves looſe of theſe intanglements, from all which we will ſhoſtly be looſed whither we will or not, we ſhould be fitter for a tentatione and have more cheerfulneſs under it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Abraham</hi> in this tentatione though he could not ſee thorow it, yet he was very confident the event would be well ordered by God, for his comfort; it was a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble anſwer he gave <hi>Iſaack</hi> goeing up the mount, when he asked him my Father where is the ſacrifice, my Sone ſaid <hi>Abraham, God will proved,</hi> as confidently as he had ſeen the Ram already caught by the horns amongſt the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:35410:102"/>buſhes: if we could, like obedient children, out of love to God follow our duety to him, we needed not be anxious what will become of this or that, it would ſatisfie us abundantly <hi>God will provide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed how darke ſoever this tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was in the begining yet there were three things remarkable in it. Which three or one of them, may be found in the event of what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation God ſhall think fitt to tryſt thee with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Abraham</hi> had a clearer diſcovery of the truth of his own grace then before, by ane immediate voice, <hi>by this I know thou loveſt me,</hi> love to Chriſt in us is often times like fire in flint, if the flint be not ſtriken upon, the fire appears not, and who knowes but thou art much doubting of it at this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if indeed thou loveſt him? But the trials for the diſcovery of it may be reſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Abraham</hi> had a cleare view of Chriſt in the Ram ready to be a ſacrifice for <hi>Iſaack,</hi> to which ſome interpreters think Chriſt rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in the 8th of <hi>John</hi> where he tells, <hi>Abraham ſaw my day affar off and rejoiced.</hi> And what canſt thou tell but this may be the event alſo of the tentations thou art ſo much afrayd of? A clearer diſcovery of Chriſt then in all thy life before. Only be content to goe to the mount, if he call thee, ſaying <hi>God will provide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> on the ſame mount, where <hi>Iſaack</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:35410:103"/>was bound, his poſterity ſaw ane ſtatly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that was one of the wonders of the world, built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> whereas any might have thought mount <hi>Moriah</hi> was the mount upon which the Church was undone in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the promiſed ſeed. Yet they ſaw the ſame mount the place where the Temple did ſtand: So contrary are Gods thoughts often to ours, and his wayes to our wayes, that light comes out of darkneſs and order out of confuſion, and life out of death.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We ſhall 1. clear the words, though not much difficulty in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His Original, imported in his name, <hi>Moſes:</hi> It was given him, as we may read <hi>Exod.</hi> 3:10. becauſe of his being <hi>drawn out</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:35410:103"/>of the water, where his Mother had layd him, in obedience to <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Edict. The Lord would have his original writt on his name, that he could not ſo much as lay to minde his very name, but he behoved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he was drawen out, for as emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a ſervant as he was, as among all the Prophets of the Old Teſtament none was like him, yet God had him to fitt for it, he found him not ſo, but drew him out when he was deſtinat to death.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing, is, his life, <hi>My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi> A Servant is one who is not at his own diſpoſal, but at the beck of another; they are as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls them <gap reason="foreign">

By way of diſtinction and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, ſome are Servants of <hi>Sin,</hi> ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures: Some are Servants of <hi>Men,</hi> in oppoſition to God: ſome, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. ſerve their own <hi>bellies;</hi> but <hi>Moſes; MY Servant.</hi> 2dly, My Servant, by way of ſpecial right and propriety, being his by election, by purchaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. yea and by Covenant, which was made at the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſh. 3dly, This, <hi>My</hi> Servant, hath ſomething of glorying in <hi>Moſes,</hi> as when the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35410:104"/>Saints ſay, <hi>My God,</hi> they triumph in their portion. So when God ſayes, <hi>My Servant,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> 1. <hi>Hes thou conſidered my Servant Job,</hi> there is a glorying in it; and this was <hi>Moſes</hi> high Elogy, that he was not a Servant of ſin, or of men, but of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> Particular, is, his End, <hi>He is dead.</hi> We have his Death threatned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. becauſe of his cariage at the waters of <hi>Meribah,</hi> and execute <hi>Deut. laſt.</hi> where he goes up to mount <hi>Nebo</hi> and dyes, and is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the plains of <hi>Moab.</hi> Though He was a great Prophet, to whom none under the Old Teſtament came near, eminently learned in all the wiſdom of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> though admitted to ſo near communion with God, yet none of theſe can exeeme him from the common lot of mankind, but he muſt dye, <hi>He is dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly cleared the words, we ſhall take ſome Obſervations from them, and be briefe in ſome of them, and inſiſt on others.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>That often, Gods moſt eminent Servants, when firſt he finds them, he hath them to draw out of ſome condition very unlike their following work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was it here with <hi>Moſes,</hi> as his very name <hi>Moſes</hi> imports. There be <hi>three</hi> things in this point, to which we ſhall ſpeak briefly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:35410:104"/>1. <hi>From what</hi> God uſually drawes his Servants out when he calls them to his work. 2dly, <hi>Why</hi> he chooſes this way, to call ſuch Servants, as he muſt firſt draw out. 3dly, Apply.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſhall have plenty of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proofes of the truth of the point, from what, to wit, he draweth them out; and here, take notice of theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Sometimes when he is about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Servants, He hath them to draw out of a very low and obſcure original in the World. Its true ſometimes he hath called them that are honourable in the World, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to be a Prophet, who is ſuppoſed to be of the blood royal of the Kings of <hi>Judah:</hi> But here he holds, <hi>not many Noble, he chooſes the things that are not.</hi> Thus, Chriſt his Apoſtles, a company of poor fiſher-men, he made them Apoſtles; <hi>Amos,</hi> ane herdsman; <hi>David,</hi> a Sheepherd; the famous <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> had it often objected to him by the <hi>Arians</hi> that he was the Son of him who was once a Begger; <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> a Baſtard, obſcurely borne in <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, He hath them to draw out from a great deal of natural ſimplicity and weakneſs, in reſpect of moral induements: So that they may ſay, as <hi>Moſes, I am not eloquent.</hi> It is true, ſome of them has been of excellent
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35410:105"/>natural induements, but often otherwayes. Therefore Heathens uſed to draw the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, in their portratures, with the head of ane aſſe on their ſhoulders, as noting the ſimplicity they ſaw in many of them, and yet eminent Servants. How igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, how timorous, and deſpondent, were the Apoſties, before the pouring out of the Spirit? How childiſh were a number of their queſtions to Chriſt, and how litle affrighted them? And yet what excellent inſtruments for Chriſt afterwards?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, He hath drawen ſome out to ſervice when their faces has been towards another airth, and their imployments lying another way in the World. It is true, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been a Prieſt ere called to have been a Prophet, and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Son of a Prieſt; But frequently he called them goeing at the plough, as <hi>Elisha;</hi> when keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheep, as <hi>David,</hi> or the cattel, as <hi>Amos;</hi> when fiſhing, he hath drawn them out, and made them Fiſhers of Men; when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Armies, as the famous <hi>Ambroſs</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>Millan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly, He nath drawn ſome out when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged in a great deal of oppoſition to him; they have been, as <hi>Paul,</hi> perſecuting him, and on the way to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> drawn out, and made choſen veſſels to lift up his name. How
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35410:105"/>farr was famous <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ingadged in <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheïſme,</hi> whoſe principles tended to deny the Being of God, and overturne his Law, and yet ingadged to be as eminent a light as any ſince the Apoſtles tymes: <hi>Matthew</hi> the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican, the firſt Writter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom he caſt ſeven Devils, the firſt preacher of the reſurrection; and many other proofs of this.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, He hath drawn ſome out from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der very great oppreſſion and perſecution, and made them eminent Servants. <hi>Daniel,</hi> a captive boy, outſtriped all the Caldeans in wiſdom and interpretation of hidden myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. What a great deal did many of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy inſtruments at the Counſel of <hi>Nite</hi> ſuffer for him, ſo that ſome bore the marks of their tortures, (as <hi>Paphunitius</hi> the want of one of his eyes) about in their bodies? Multitudes of ſuch might be inſtanced, and all theſe will be the more remarkable, if we conſider the <hi>way</hi> of the Lords drawing out in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, He hath made his word the mean of drawing them out to his ſervice, when they themſelves have been farr from intending any ſuch thing: <hi>Auguſtin</hi> came from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> meerly to hear <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his eloquence, and yet by his Sermon drawn out, though he
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35410:106"/>little regarded his doctrine. <hi>Virgerius</hi> was ſet downe to writt a Book <hi>De Apoſtaſia Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum,</hi> that he might vindicat himſelf from the ſuſpition of <hi>Lutheraniſmt,</hi> and turning over <hi>Luthers</hi> Books, that he might anſwer his arguments, was drawn out to the great oppoſition of Popery he afterward mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Some drawn out by occaſional un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected providence, from which no ſuch thing was expected. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> came to behold the Martyrdome of ſome of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, meerly as a gazer and looker on, and by their conſtancy and cheerfulneſs was put to ſearch after their doctrine, and drawn out to be ane eminent Servant?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, When they have only deſigned ſome bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of ſervice to him, and to hold there, when it were done, he hath drawn them on ſtep after ſtep to great things; there was no more deſigned by <hi>Luther</hi> at firſt but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Popiſh <hi>Indulgences,</hi> but ſtep after ſtep he was drawn to overturne the whole body of Popiſh doctrine. In a word, a ſmall lyne in his hand, is ſtrong enough to draw out his moſt reſolut adverſaries.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing we propoſed was, <hi>Why</hi> God ſo often chooſed this way? Here take notice of theſe three: <hi>Firſt,</hi> He layes a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his own praiſe. 2dly, For hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:35410:106"/>his Servants. 3dly, For confirming the truths delivered by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For his own <hi>praiſe,</hi> eſpecially of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>grace.</hi> 1. His <hi>power</hi> ſhynes in it, that he can take any ſtuffe and make a veſſel of honour off it, to make a Roſe grow out of a Thorne; what a great demonſtration of power was it to take <hi>Paul</hi> on his way to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> and draw him then out? Beſide 2dly, That demonſtrats his <hi>Grace</hi> in the riches and freedom of it, that no native baſeneſs, no affliction, no oppoſition to him, can hinder him from honouring them with his honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It keeps his Servants <hi>humble,</hi> to remember how drawn out; <hi>not worthy to be called ane Apoſtle,</hi> and why, <hi>I perſecuted the Church,</hi> Eminent ſervice is apt to puff up even the beſt, but when they look on what they were, and how drawn out, they muſt let their Feathers fall.</p>
            <p>Beſide, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This tends to confirme the doctrine delivered by them, that when they firſt did begin to preach it, their faces were another way, <hi>I was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor Son of a Prophet,</hi> ſaid Amos, <hi>and the Lord ſaid unto me, Goe Propheſy at Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:</hi> It was no deſign of his who was looking over his kin. What can be more rational then what <hi>Paul</hi> alledges in his own defence
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35410:107"/>before <hi>Aggripa,</hi> that he was once <hi>zealous in the Jewish Religion, and perſecuted Chriſtians,</hi> but could not be diſobedient to the <hi>heavenly viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By way of uſe breifly take theſe things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> See the remarkable way which God hath been conſtantly uſing to build his Church. He hath not found the ſtones polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his hand, which he hath been laying in his temple, but had them to hew out of a hard rock, and digg out of a pitt; ſo much the more ought wee to admire his progreſſe in the work; look but on the begining of our refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matione from Popery, and wonder at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, that ve may aſcribe the praiſe to the principal agent. <hi>Luther</hi> in a Popiſh cell, <hi>Calvin</hi> a big of Papiſt, <hi>Beza</hi> not only a Papiſt, but even looſe, ſo that Papiſts by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach objected his <hi>Juvenilia</hi> to him, and he forced to tell they envyed to him the grace of God; and yet what done by them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This may incourage, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the caſe of the Church for the time to come. Often we ſtand asking, by whom will the Lord deliver <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And where are the inſtruments to be found fitt for the work? But, cannot he, who drew out <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> draw out; Either he can raiſe up new or elevat the Spirits of ſuch as are, What a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:35410:107"/>change did the pouring out of the Spirit make on the Apoſtles? How boldly goe they to the temple to preach? With what confidence and freedome of ſpeech appear they before Counſels, and witneſs for Chriſt? He is the ſame he was then who did effectuat this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This ſhould make us hopefully pray for either ſuch as are moſt indiſpoſed for ſervice, or moſt reluctant to it, ſince we have to do with one who can ſo eaſily draw them out, and make them Veſhels meet for his uſe. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi> aſcribed much to his Mother <hi>Monica's</hi> Prayers, who, even when he was a <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chean,</hi> ceaſed not to wreſtle with God for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This ſhould keep ſuch as are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with eminent ſervice <hi>humble;</hi> when they call to mind what once they were, and how drawn out to their work, what have the beſt but what they have received? And if received, why glory they of it, as though it had not been received? But I goe to the <hi>ſecond</hi> branch, haveing dwelt too long on this: <hi>my ſervant, Moſes</hi> his life and great Elogy.</p>
            <p>Obſerv. II. <hi>That it is the greateſt Elogy and higheſt commendation of a Man after his death, that in his life he hath been Gods Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is here <hi>Moſes</hi> his great teſtimony, <hi>my ſervant</hi> is dead. It is true, all the creatures are
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:35410:108"/>in their kind ſubſervient, and his great eſtene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doe his work. But as this is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>operantis,</hi> ſo it is but ſome ſins of common ſervice; but to be <hi>his</hi> as in the explication, by way of diſtinction or propriety, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> is a mans greateſt elogy in death.</p>
            <p>We ſhall, 1ſt, prove the point from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 2dly, Give ſome grounds of it. 3dly, Apply it.</p>
            <p>From Scripture, theſe things will prove it. 1ſt. It is the name given to the moſt eminent Saints, as their Title of greateſt honour, <hi>Abraham my Servant, Job my Servant, Jacob my Servant, David my Servant;</hi> The greateſt Prophets and Apoſtles glory in it, <hi>Paul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes it to ſome of his Epiſties, <hi>Paul a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2dly, This Name is given to the greateſt Princes; <hi>Nebuthad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To evidence it further, conſider that there have been many things pitched on in the world, as things commending men after their death, according to the diverſity of mens lives.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is the higheſt wiſdome. <hi>His fear is the beginning of wiſdome, and a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have all they that doe his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> If we ſould take even the rule given by <hi>Aziſtotle,</hi> whereby wiſdom is diſcerned, all would agree to his ſervice. <hi>Moſes</hi> is brief in determining wherein wiſdome conſiſts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4:6. <hi>Keep his ſtatutes, for this is your wiſdome.</hi> Yea where his ſervice is wanting, the Scripture ſpeaks of men as fools, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8:9. <hi>Since they have rejected the word of God, what wiſdome is in them?</hi> They are indeed fooliſh Virgins who make no proviſion for the time to come; Though they ſhould be able, with <hi>Berengari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:35410:109"/>wiſdome commend a Man at death, it is a high Elogy to be his Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is no trade of life ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>the way of life is above to the wiſe.</hi> There be four things will diſcover how honourable a ſervice it is. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they are taken up with the nobleſt objects. <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call their Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pniſicks <hi>ſcientia Nobiliſſima, quia tractant de en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e altiſſimo.</hi> They are either meditating or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in God, or with Angels, doeing his commandments. Others, with <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> are ſpending their time with fleas. But his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, like <hi>Caleb,</hi> have ane other Spirit, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. conſtantly follow him. 2dly, They act theſe great things from the nobleſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Love</hi> conſtraineth, yea by <hi>regeneration</hi> they partake of the divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. which elevats the Spirit farr above what the moſt famous among <hi>Grecians,</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> could ever reach. 3dly, They drive at the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ends; ſuch as the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. the good of his Church, the ſalvation of their own ſouls. Others, like men of low Spirits, have but low deſignes, <hi>who will shew us any good? Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They receive the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt reward; <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a crowne of immortal glory; bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Lord shall finde waiting, verily I ſay unto you, he shall make him ruler over all that he hath;</hi> what more can be imagined, if this
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35410:109"/>be not? More, <hi>He will gird himſelf, and ſtand, and ſerve him:</hi> So that, if true honour commend a man at death, it is a high elogy then to have been a Servant to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it is honourable, ſo it is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gainful to be his Servants: <hi>Godlineſs is great Gain, for it hath the promiſes of this life, and that which is to come,</hi> like ſhips that goe to a farr country, they keep a trade with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where they have wyne, and milk, and honey, and whyt linen, and eye-ſalve, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money and without pryce. No ſooner doth his elect Children, though prodigals before, come to their Fathers houſe, but they are clothed with the beſt rob, and fed on the fatted calfe, and have a ring on their hand, and ſhoes on their feet. It is true, that which uſually goes under the name of riches, is not their portion, but their gain is more noble, &amp; they lay up to themſelves where the moth cannot enter; ſo that if riches and ſtill to gain, can commend one's life, to be Gods Servant muſt be a high elogy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As it is gainful, ſo exceeding pleaſant, to be his Servant. We may ſay, as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Servants, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe Servants who ſtand by and hear the wiſdome of thy words.</hi> This is the ſcope of the whole Song, to ſhew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his Servants. Take but a view of their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:35410:110"/>pleaſures in theſe three. 1. What excellent walks they have. 2dly, What excellent company in theſe walks. 3dly, What ſweet fellowſhip with this company. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their walks are ſometymes to the Green Paſturs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. ſometymes to the tillages, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes to the gardens, to ſee if the pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats bud, ſometymes to the banquetting houſe; It is true, they walk ſometymes alſo down to the wilderneſs, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2:14. ay but there they are <hi>allured,</hi> and a <hi>door of hope</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them. 2. What excellent company in theſe walks? <hi>Enoch walked with God, Gen.</hi> 6. If to walk with the Wyſe be, in <hi>Solomons</hi> eyes, ſo great a priviledge, what to walk with the <hi>only wiſe God?</hi> 3dly, What ſweet fellowſhip in theſe walks? Sometymes they fit down under his ſhaddow, ſometymes he kiſſes them with the kiſſes of his mouth, ſometymes he ſups with them, ſometymes he taks them in his boſome, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 40:11. How pleaſant a life muſt this be? The Apoſtle thinks nothing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. to call it <hi>the life of God.</hi> Others, like the elder Brother, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. get never a kid to make mirry with, but they delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in fatneſs. Muſt it not then be a high elogy to be his Servant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They dryve the ſweeteſt life. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than can tell God of <hi>Job, Haſt thou not ſet a hedge about him, and about all he hath?</hi> About
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:35410:110"/>
               <hi>all</hi> he hath, is much; Who is he that will harme you, if ye be followers of that which is good? <hi>Who is he?</hi> It is ſuch ane expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as that of <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> to <hi>Eſther, Who is he, or where is the man, that durſt preſume to doe this?</hi> It is the higheſt act of boldneſs that ever the creatur attempted, to be a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter of them who have ſalvation for walls and bulwarks, and are ſheltered under the faithfulneſs of God, as a bird under the Feathers of the Dam, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. Lay all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither and ſee if it be not a high elogy to be his Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is it ſo great a priviledge to be his Servant? It reproves the undervaluers of it. Many caſt at it as a bondadge, even of ſuch who call him Maſter and Lord, but the loweſt imployments in his ſervice, <hi>David</hi> preferred it to a dwelling in the tents of wickedneſs. Some, like <hi>Canaan,</hi> are Servant of Servants, and deſpyſe their own mercy. Rectify thy opinion of his ſervice, ſince it is the honour of Angels, who are oftener in the Scriptures denominat from their ſervice, then their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though moſt pure and excellent Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is it ſuch a priviledge to be his Servant? Then ſtudy to doe his ſervice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably?
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:35410:111"/>There are theſe qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in his Servants.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, They cannot ſerve two Maſters, for they muſt cleave to the one, and leave the other. Thou muſt give up with luſts, with Sathan, the World, neither ſerve men in oppoſition to him; theſe oppoſitions caſts many out of his ſervice and with <hi>Gideons</hi> 22000 they returne to their tents.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, A Servant is not <hi>ſui juris,</hi> but at the Beck of his Maſter, as the Centurions, if he ſay to one goe, he muſt goe; ye muſt not ſtand and diſput your duty, his will is reaſon eneugh, though it were to ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, though it were to walk on a ſea of trouble, we ought to ſay with <hi>Peter, Maſter, if thou wilt bid me, I will come unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, His ſervice muſt be done cheerfully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110:3. It is true, we are to ſerve him with reverence, and godly fear, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12:28. yet this is not inconſiſtant with cheerfulneſs. He loves not to have it wrung out of us, as ſervice to ane auſtere and rigorous Maſter, as the man who had the one talent called him; but we are to rejoice in trembling.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, We muſt ſtudy in every thing to doe him ſervice; Servants are to obey their Maſters, as the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt; directing and referring to his honour,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:35410:111"/>their moſt ordinary imployments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We muſt not lay ſtreſſe on our ſervice, as if it deſerved our fie, <hi>When we have done all, we are unprofitable Servants.</hi> Yea, though he ſay, <hi>well done, good and faithful Servant,</hi> yet out reply ought to be, <hi>When ſaw we thee hungry, and ſed thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is conſolation for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: Their priviledge is great, though their ſervice were never ſo low; Eſpecially ſince they are friends, als well as Servants. Yea, he that doeth the will of Chriſt, he is his Father, his Mother, his Brother, his Siſter. Rejoice in your priviledge though it ſhould have a mixture of the croſſe with it.</p>

            </p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:35410:112"/>
            <p>In handling this, we ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſomethings peculiar in <hi>Moſes</hi> his death which may yeeld us ground of very uſeful inſtruction. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ſhall ſpeak of death, as a common lot, from which none of the moſt eminent Servants of God, though as eminent as <hi>Moſes,</hi> can expect to be exeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Moſes is dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, in <hi>Moſes</hi> his death, we ſhall take notice of theſe three things very remarkable in it. 1. The <hi>cauſe</hi> of it. 2. The <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>circumſtance</hi> of it. 3. Some <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> that followed on it. In which three, amongſt other things, we ſhall have a notable diſcovery of the juſtice, mercy, and faithfulneſs of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Take notice of the <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> death. Ye have it ſet down in the 20th of the <hi>Numbers,</hi> where, at <hi>Meribah,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thriſting and wanting water, the Lord bids <hi>Moſes, v.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>take his rod, and ſpeak to the rock,</hi> and <hi>Moſes ſmites</hi> the rock twyce with the rod, for the which the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him, that he ſhould not bring the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to the land which he had given them. This was the cauſe of his death, and in this I deſire ye may mark theſe five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, How many proofs of faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God had <hi>Moſes</hi> given, who was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the Apoſtle teſtifies, as a Servant, yet
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:35410:112"/>
               <hi>all his former ſervice cannot expiat this one ſin,</hi> but he muſt die for it. It is the way of a great many, upon commiſſion of any ſin, they think to expiat it by their former or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obedience; but though our ſervice were as eminent as <hi>Moſes's</hi> was, it cannot at all make a mends for one ſin to God. It is good there is a cautioner, who takes all his peoples debt on him, ſince it is impoſſible for us to expiat ſin, though we had never ſo many moral parts, (as <hi>Moſes,</hi> learned in all wiſdom of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>) never ſo great a Prophet, never ſo much zeal, or communion with God, yet all this cannot remove one ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, In this cauſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> death, remark that it was not in doeing any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to the command of God, only a doeing <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> it, he exeeded his commiſſion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what he did might have had many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of reaſon for it. The rod had been the inſtrument of many mirackles in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and at the red Sea, yea at <hi>Rephidim</hi> he did ſtrick the rock with it and brought water: But ſince his commiſſion was to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> his <hi>ſtriking</hi> was his ſin, for which he muſt die. <hi>So dangerous a thing it is, in things relating to God, to act without his warrand.</hi> Some tell us, they add no corrupting additions to the word, but perfecting; But, as corrupting additions is a contradiction, ſo perfecting are eminently
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35410:113"/>reflecting both on the Law and Law-giver. Ye may be preſſed with things which will be told you are lawful becauſe not contrary to the word: But if they be not conſonant, ye are in danger of anger from him who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden all adding to his word, as well as taking from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Undoubtedly this ſin, for which <hi>Moſes</hi> died, was pardoned, as to any guilt which ſhould draw any eternal puniſhment after it. Yea more, many friendly acts, after this ſmiting the rock, paſſed betwixt God and him, yet he muſt die for it. <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> fooliſhly tell us that the ſins of the elect, being pardoned, there are no chaſtiſements layed on for ſin. Nay, <hi>the ſin which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, the perſon may yet be corrected for it;</hi> as is evident here, and in <hi>Nathans</hi> words to <hi>David, The Lord hath alſo put away thy ſin, nevertheleſs thy Child shall dy.</hi> Argue not then from a temporal chaſtiſement, to ane eternal puniſhment; Since the very ſin which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, may yet influence ſad ſtroks, yea and death it ſelfe.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, This was but one ſin of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he acted alſo when his meek Spirit was provoked by a ſtiff-necked people, and yet it is followed by the ſame outward ſtroke, with which their ſins, who had tempted 40 years in the wilderneſs, is followed; their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35410:113"/>ſtroak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. <hi>Is, not to enter Canaan,</hi> but dy by the way; and for this one ſin, <hi>Moſes</hi> meets with the ſame. <hi>Is is very remarkable, how sharply the Lord will chaſtiſe a little thing in his own, when he will let others runn on till their cup be full.</hi> It is true, the ſins of his elect ſervants have many aggravations the ſins of others wants, as being acted againſt more light, againſt greater mercies, yet the thing in itſelf but litle, in compariſon of what he will paſs in another. Caſt not at his ſervice notwithſtanding of this; better to to have our way in ſin hedged with thornes, then ſtrawed with roſes. It is dreadful to have ſcope in ſin, and when, like <hi>Balaam</hi> in the way to <hi>Balack,</hi> have the Lord ſay to us, <hi>goe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly, <hi>Moſes</hi> earneſtly prayed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. that the Lord would have averted this ſtroke, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>I pray thee let me goe over, and ſee this goodly Land beyond Jordan, and that goodly Mountain, and Lebanon;</hi> fain would he have been there, but there is no dealing, <hi>let it ſuffice thee, ſpeak no more of this matter,</hi> is his anſwer. <hi>How earneſt will the beſt be for temporary mercies, and how peremptor in prayer for them when yet their prayer caſt out?</hi> It is true, a view of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> had by way of exchange, declares the prayer not loſt, though refuſed. Now in all theſe in <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:35410:114"/>death, ſee how juſt God is in reckoning for ſin, even in the beſt of his Saints?</p>
            <p>But in the next place, let us take a view of his mercy mixed in herewith, in the manner of <hi>Moſes</hi> death: which is the 2d thing propoſed. And here alſo take notice of five things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> However the Lord will have him die for this ſin, yet he warnes him of it a long time before he die; yea and determines both tyme &amp; place, <hi>Got up to mount Nebo &amp; dy.</hi> It is a great incouragment to the Saints in their death, that it comes not on them as a thiefe in the night, yea and though it be not revealed to them, as to <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet both tyme and place are ſo determined, as all their adverſaries cannot alter the leaſt circumſtance, though one of them dy in his bed, another in the ſea, the third in a foraign land, yet not one hair of their head falls without their heavenly Father his providence; and though ſecondary cauſes work contingently, yet the event fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes neceſſarly, as it is decreed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ere he die, though the Lord chaſtiſe him for his ſin, yet the Lord gives him a view of <hi>Canaan</hi> before his death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3:27. <hi>Get thee up to the top of Piſgah, and behold it with thine eyes.</hi> The paſſage through the valey of the ſhadow of death, is indeed dowiſome, but a view of <hi>Canaan</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:35410:114"/>will make it ſo lightſome, that ſome of the Saints have cryed out on death for his ſlow motions toward them, and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of ſickneſs, that threatned death, have halfe repyned that they ſhould have been within ſight of the land, and yet driven back to Sea again. And wyſely the Lord reſerves theſe ſights of <hi>Canaan,</hi> till his Saints have death to graple with, that he may allay a litle the bitter pill, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar it better, before they ſwallow it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a chaſtiſement of his unbeleife, yet withall a Reward of his faith, which he had ane eye to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 15. When he preferred the reproach of Chriſt to the treaſures of Aegypt. <hi>There is indeed in death ſomething bumbling to the Saints, but there is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comfortable:</hi> If it be a fruit of ſin, and the wages of it, it is likewayes the paſſage to glory; and the truth is, as in our life ſo till it end, betwixt the views of ſin and glory, our joyes and ſorrowes eb and flow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Moſes</hi> death, though it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his diſobedience, yet it was in it ſelfe ane act of obedience, the ſame God who bid him goe down to Aegypt and ſpeak to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> bids him now goe up to mount <hi>Nebo</hi> and dy, and he obeyes the one als
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:35410:115"/>well as the other, up he goes and dyes; as it is ſaid of Chriſt, ſo may it be ſaid of his Saints, <hi>He was obedient unto the death,</hi> ſo are they. There are ſome, their ſouls are <hi>taken</hi> from them, and they are carried to death, as a priſoner unto ward by the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, but his people <hi>give</hi> up the Ghoſt, when it is called for; and as they lived obeying, ſo they dy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Moſes</hi> in his death was careful for Iſrael, that it ſhould proſper after he was dead; for this end he repeats the Law over again to them in the book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> allures, and threatnes them to ſtedfaſtneſs in it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynts them a ſucceſſor to him, and layes his hand on <hi>Joſuae.</hi> There are two acts we find performed, by two eminent Saints, in reference to the Church after their death, and they that cannot doe the one, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the good of it when they are gone, may yet doe the other: <hi>Moſes</hi> leaves a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten law to them to walk by: <hi>Joſeph</hi> acts faith on the promiſe, <hi>I know the Lord will viſit you,</hi> and he will have them ſwear to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry up his bones. If thou cannot writt books to be ſtanding monuments of the Church's duties, yet be, with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> acting faith for the proſperity of it, upon the promiſe, and thus one way or another, thou may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the good of it when thou art gone.</p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:35410:115"/>
            <p>But in the <hi>third</hi> place, take a view of ſome conſequences of <hi>Moſes</hi> death. I ſhall, for brevities ſake, name but theſe three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Lord takes the charge on him of burying his Servant, <hi>Deut.</hi> laſt. <hi>The Lord buried him in the plains of Moab.</hi> His care of his Saints bodies ends not with their lives. It is the Fathers will that he ſhould loſe nothing of what is given him, but takes it up at the laſt day, and gives it life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Mark, it is not <hi>no man,</hi> but <hi>no thing</hi> of any of them given him, the body that did run, and act, and ſpeak in his ſervice, he caſts it not off at death, as ane unprofitable old Servant, but looks after it, even though the bodies ſhould be given to be food to the foules of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This burial of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, as no man knew of it; the common and indeed the true reaſon was, to prevent ſuperſtition, which readily Iſrael would have fallen into, with theſe precious relicts. If the Lord ever had intended ſuch a high eſteem of the relicts of the Saints, as ſome preſs, he had never concealed the body of <hi>Moſes:</hi> We have reaſon to praiſe, that we are not intoxicat with the poyſon of thoſe who adore the creature more then the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and delude the World with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries of relicts, which, though true, as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:35410:116"/>they are not, yet ought not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatry with; the Lord did here, as a wyſe parcht, take the knyfe out of the childs hand, leaſt he ſhould cut his fingers with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This <hi>Moſes,</hi> though none knew what became of his body, nor where it was layd, yet we find him afterward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious on mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> at the transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration. It is in effect no matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of our bodies after death, ſince the Saints may be aſſured, one day to appear and be like his glorious body, let Philoſophers debeat where are they that are eaten by fiſh, and theſe fiſh eaten by men, and the bodies of theſe men turned into graſſe, and that graſſe eaten by beaſts, &amp;c. though we can no more tell what is become of them, nor Iſrael could tell what became of the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is comfortable enough, he will make them like his glorious body, by the mighty power, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelfe. This much for the things particularly obſervable in <hi>Moſes</hi> death.</p>
            <p>We come now in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, to ſpeak of death, as a lot from which the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervants cannot expect to be exeemed.</p>
            <p>Obſervation, <hi>That there are none, how eminent ſoever, in parts, holyneſs, or
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:35410:116"/>communion with God, can expect to be exeemed from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eminent was <hi>Moſes</hi> in all theſe, yet <hi>Moſes</hi> is dead; yea, ſee through all the Scripture from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Chriſt, Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, whoſe extraordinare tranſlation ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>vicem mortis,</hi> who are exeemed from it. Neither need we inſiſt on the reaſons of this, ſince it is decreed for all, <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dy,</hi> and after death, to come to judgment. Yea 2dly, All are intereſted in <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and ſo lyable to the puniſhment of it, which in part is temporal death. 3dly, Actual ſin influences this, the wages whereof is death. It is among the errors of <hi>Socinians</hi> to ſay, death is only a natural fruit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the body. It is true, it does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed naturally follow on it, but man being immortalized by Covenant before the fall, the loſs of that priviledge makes death to him a puniſhment and the wages of ſin, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6: <hi>laſt.</hi> words it.</p>
            <p>That which I ſhall inſiſt a litle on, is, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Why Chriſt hath not reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored his Saints to ane exemption from death, which by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall they have forfaulted? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Though Chriſt hath not done this, yet he hath done ſo much in reference to it, that the Apoſtle is not afrayed, to ſay, he hath <hi>abolished death,</hi> and, <hi>brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:35410:117"/>to light, by the Goſpel.</hi> We ſhall therefore inſiſt a litle in opening the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt the death of the Saints through Chriſt, and the death of others.</p>
            <p>There be eſpecially this threefold diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them. 1. In reſpect of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dying. 2dly, In reſpect of death it ſelf. 3dly, In reſpect of the conſequences of it. This <hi>Balaam</hi> obſerved, when he ſaid, <hi>Let my end be as their end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In regard of the perſons dying, the difference is great, eſpecially in theſe <hi>three:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, The Servants of God, though they dy, yet they dy in Chriſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14: v. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord:</hi> As they believed in the Lord, and walked in the Lord, and rejoiced in the Lord, ſo they dy in the Lord; death does not looſe their union; not ſo with others.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, They dy in faith, <hi>All theſe dy in faith,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>haveing a good report;</hi> they dy in faith for themſelves, for the Church of God, for their relations, and in the faith of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever promiſed: not ſo others.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, They die in obedience; as Chriſt was obedient to the death, ſo their very death is an act of obedience, <hi>Goe up to mount Nebo and dy,</hi> the doeing whereof was obedience, as well as goe down to <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:35410:117"/>goe in to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or ſuch like commands as <hi>Moſes</hi> obeyed. Not ſo others, their ſoul is <hi>taken</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The difference is great in regard of death itſelfe. Mark eſpecially theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though the thing be a curſe in it ſelfe, it is a bleſſing to the man, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dy in the Lord;</hi> the curſe is not only removed, but converted, it is now a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3: laſt. <hi>All things are yours, and ye are Chriſts, whither things preſent, or things to come, death or life.</hi> Here death is theirs who are <hi>Chriſts,</hi> as a Servant is his Maſters, <hi>Death is yours, and ye are Chriſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The ſting of death is removed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15:55. It is now as a bee that cannot ſting, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9:21. It may well bumb, and make a noyſe, but ſin and the hurtful ſting of it, is removed. It is not ſo with others: the ſting and all remains.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The dominion of it is removed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5:14. there are ſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. that death ſhall have dominion over; not ſo in the Saints, Prevail it may, as they have prevailing ſins, which are not reigning, ſo alſo death, which is not ringing: Now he that removes theſe three, may he not be ſaid to have aboliſhed death?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The difference greateſt of all is in regard of the conſequences of death.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:35410:118"/>Where, 1. conſider from what death liberates the Saints. 2. To what by it they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, They are taken away from the evil to come, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57:1. As <hi>Methuſaleh</hi> was taken away before the flood: They are taken away from the vexations of Spirit at the ſins of others, from the polutions they would be in danger of readily from the perſecution and oppreſſion to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, By death they are delivered from the tentations of Sathan. Grace here may influence their not yeelding to thoſe tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but it cannot deliver them from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation itſelf. On the contrary, if they are holy, the more like they are to be tempted. <hi>Chriſt, Job, Aſaph,</hi> and ſuch like, moſt tempted; Not ſo others.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, They are removed and delivered from the being of ſin; the Dominion of it is indeed removed in ſanctification, but now the being. And what a priviledge is that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider to what they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by it; to count which by particulars is impoſſible, the exellency of it is ſo great, being that which ear hath not heard, eye hath not ſeen, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conſider. From all which it is evident, that though Chriſt hath not exeemed a <hi>Moſes</hi> from death altogither, yet there is ſuch a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:35410:118"/>difference betwixt their death and other's, that in ſome conſiderable ſenſe, he may be ſaid to have aboliſhed death.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt in applying ſo frequently preſſed a point; only, ſince it is the common lot of all men, let all prepare for it. Our whole life is a ſcoole wherein we ſhould be learning to die. It is an eminent act of wiſedome, <hi>O that they were wyſe to conſider their latter end!</hi> Even in our garden amongſt our greateſt pleaſures, we ſhould be walking beſide our grave, like <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea.</hi> So live, Chriſtian, as thou goe not out like a candle, that leaves ane ill ſmell behind it.</p>
